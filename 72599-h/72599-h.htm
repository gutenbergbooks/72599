</div>


<p>Prophecy, not history, is the most truly important
concern of music in America. What a new world, with
new processes and new ideals, will do with the tractable
and still unformed art of music; what will arise
from the contact of this art with our unprecedented
democracy—these are the questions of deepest import
in our musical life in the United States. The past has
consisted chiefly of a tasting of the musical art and
traditions of the old world. The present is divided
between imitation of the old and searching for the
new, both in quality and application. The fruitage
of our national musical life is still for the future.
Intense as are the activities of the present, they
are still merely the preparation of the soil for a
future growth the nature and extent of which we can
only guess at to-day. The stream of musical evolution
in America, in the present transitional period, is rapidly
overflowing its wonted banks, and passing the boundaries
of the traditional musical world. The many are
striving to obtain that which has been the exclusive
possession of the few, and in this endeavor are not only
extending, but also actually transforming the art. The
paramount issues change with the passing of the seasons.
One imported European sensation gives way to
another. The problem of the true basis of American
music dissolves overnight, and gives way to the problem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
of the specific evaluation of individual composers,
whatsoever their tendency. The questions of the narrow
concert world dwindle before the greater question
of a broad musical administration for the people. We
stand, in fact, in a state of chaos with respect of musical
activities and ideals, and only the clearest thinkers are
able to catch the truer and larger drift of the national
evolution, or effectively direct it. Too many persons
are ready to suppose that the issues of music in
America lie wholly within the scope of purely musical
considerations, and that they do not depend, as is actually
the case in certain important respects, upon the
nature of the national ideals and tendencies. The national
need will condition the supply, and the more
truly and deeply a national need is fulfilled, the more
vital will be the result. For this reason it is important
that the general national condition with respect of
music be carefully studied, and that misconceptions
and theories be relinquished in favor of a knowledge
of facts.</p>

<p>If now we set out to glance over the circumstances
which have eventually brought about the present condition
of music in America, we find that this history,
taken in its largest outlines, has a threefold aspect, the
features of which may be roughly termed appreciation,
creation, and administration. The degree in which
the new world has grasped and understood the facts
of musical development in the old must constitute a
chief factor in any consideration of its musical evolution,
and this subject will naturally include a reference
to musical culture in America. The second general
division of the subject relates to American composers
and the creative musical output of the nation. The
matter of the appreciation of this output will best be
touched upon in connection with this aspect of the subject.
With the question of administration we approach
a phase of the subject which has of late assumed momentous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
proportions, touching directly, as it does, the
great question of the relation of music to the people—the
reaction of democracy to the art of music. The
divisions of Appreciation and Administration are, of
course, very closely related, and some chapters, such as
that on Education, embody both aspects in almost equal
degree. Hence the line cannot be very sharply drawn.
Our sequence of chapters, while emphasizing the three
aspects here set forth, has therefore been arranged with
a view to presenting as continuous a story as possible.
The chapters reviewing the creative activities of American
composers have accordingly been placed together
at the end of the volume.</p>

<p>We can not deeply consider the matter of the appreciation
of the musical art of the old world by the new,
without coming to the realization that it is complete.
This, it must be recognized, is a matter which does not
ultimately depend upon the numerical extent of the
appreciators, but upon the quality of appreciation existing
within the nation. Were this not so, we could
not affirm the existence of a complete appreciation
of its musical art by any nation of the world. In the
broad sense in which we must necessarily speak in
dealing only with the major facts of civilization and
evolution, we may say that German musical art is
appreciated by the German nation, even if only here
or there someone is found who understands precisely
the principles of Beethoven's form, or Wagner's harmony.
In the practical progress of the world it is
general acceptance and use, together with a sufficient
artistic appreciation, technical and otherwise, on the
part of certain individuals, which constitutes national
appreciation of art. The knowledge and action of such
preëminent individuals qualify the appreciative life
of the nation. The evolution of the world to-day resides
in the evolution of the progressive thought of
individuals. Such thought outdistances the slower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
mental operations of the mass, which is nevertheless
drawn along into ever new sets of changing conditions,
through the modern development of the means of communication
and the corresponding rapidity of both
material and spiritual advance.</p>

<p>Such conditions of appreciation exist in a signal
manner in the America of to-day. It is the simplest
and most obvious of facts that there is a general acceptance
and use of European musical art, old and
new, throughout the 'musical world' of America. The
relation of that 'musical world' to the whole population
will be considered later. It is equally obvious to the
qualified observer that no point of European musical
art is without its thorough-going students and appreciators,
and ardent conservators, in America. From Bach
and Haydn, nay, from the Gregorian chant, the Greek
enharmonic, the Oriental scale, down through every
intermediate period and personality to the present day
of Stravinsky and Schönberg, every phase of musical
history and life has its students and its champions in
the new world. America has, in truth, summed up the
musical life of the ages and reflects it daily in the
multitudinous activities of her musical world. The
quality of American appreciation has one advantage
of the greatest significance over that of any other land,
in that it is without national or racial prejudice. Being
without history or unity, with respect of race, the
American people are without a racial folk-song, and
hence are bound by no ancient racial sympathy or
habit to a particular fundamental conception of the
character of music. German music, French, Russian,
Bohemian, Scandinavian, Italian—all are accepted
with equal eagerness and sympathy. In America the
world's music falls on fresh ears, with the result that a
catholicity of taste prevails such as is to be found in
no other land, and with the further result that a unique
and broadly inclusive national impression of musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
character in general has been gained. This in turn is
leading to a national creative musical output which,
if it has not converged upon any one distinctive
national character, is, on the other hand, wholly free
from dependence upon the traditional character of
the music of any other nation, and could have been
produced by no other nation.</p>

<p>The upshot of the status of American appreciation
of musical art is that, although the work of more
extensively familiarizing the population with the
world's music must continue, the evolution, broadly,
of America as an appreciative nation has been fulfilled,
and it can from now on find no true musical progress
except as a creative nation. Not only has it studied,
at home and abroad, all that the outside world has
produced, but it has now thoroughly studied the various
phases of aboriginal music which exist upon its
own soil. The national life has passed beyond its
school days and entered the period where it has no
alternative but to face judgment as a musically productive
nation with legitimate pretensions to maturity.</p>

<p>In view of the intense musical interest and eagerness
of the American people, of the vigorous and very
rapidly expanding development of musical life in the
United States since the Civil War, and the enormous
sums which the nation spends annually for musical
education, both at home and abroad, it would be irrational
to expect anything less than the results above
indicated. Musical education, which has played so
vast a part in this development, shares, nevertheless,
the general chaotic condition of American musical life.
The absence of a National Academy of Music leaves
the country still without any official standard of musical
education, although high ideals and thorough
courses are maintained in the music departments of
the larger universities. There are several independent
musical academies and conservatories of high standing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
with a sufficiently broad and well ordered curriculum,
and an unnumbered mass of nondescript music
schools innocent of all normal standards. The same
scale, from the highest excellence to downright charlatanism,
is to be found in the field of private instruction,
and one of the greatest educational problems which the
nation faces is to bring some element of standardization
into this field. This is a matter for state action,
and in several states a movement is well under way
for the licensing of music teachers. The development
of music in the public schools, well grounded in the
early part of the last century, has of late years been
pushed with vigor and intelligence, and has led to unprecedented
studies in the adaptation of music to the
child, as well as to the composition of a great quantity
of new and appropriate children's songs of excellent
quality. The chief difficulty with national musical
progress through the public schools lies in the fact that
such a minute proportion of public school scholars go
to high school and college, most of them losing all contact
with musical education before reaching an age
when their interest in it can be firmly established. This
circumstance is now happily being continually more
widely met from extra-educational quarters, in the
present movement for music for the people through
various channels to be referred to later. Professional
educators are inclined to lay too much stress on school
education as a means of developing appreciation in the
mass, forgetting that the time must come when the
chief musical training of the people, with respect of
their ultimate enjoyment of music, must consist in a
general public hearing of music of the highest order.</p>

<p>In centres of highly refined musical culture, America,
from East to West, is not lacking. An aristocracy of
musical appreciation has followed upon the establishment
of symphonic and chamber music organizations
in a number of cities. This culture is, however, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
exclusively devoted to the maintenance of traditional
European standards, and is inclined to take slight cognizance
of the native and democratic developments in
which the true national progress of the present lies.
The presence of such a culture in America is therefore
not altogether an unmixed blessing; in fact it may lead
to certain results of positive evil. The presence of
retrospective hyper-refinement in a nation at a time
when rugged creative strength, even if crude in its artistic
results, should be manifested, may be harmful
in its effect upon normal creative progress, especially
when, with the backing of wealth, the press, and the
academy, it arrogates to itself the possession of the
true vision of artistic standards.</p>

<p>If, then, the tide of musical appreciation in America
has reached a normal level, in accordance with the
general civilization of the world of to-day, if the appreciative
era, purely as such, is past, the creative
epoch has only fairly begun. America, in musical composition,
already reckons a historical sequence approaching
to a classical, a romantic and an ultra-modern
period, exhibiting the strange spectacle of most
of the founders of the first period living to see the
flowering of the last, during their active lifetime. In
fact, some of the pioneers have actively engaged in
fostering the issues of all three epochs. The truth of
this curious condition is that this triple-aspected development
of the past fifty years can not in reality be said
to represent even the beginning of the actual creative
epoch of the nation. As the child is said to pass
through phases corresponding to the entire ancient history
of the race, so this chapter in American music
represents the rapid passage of the youthful America
through the previous history of the art; it has represented
the desire to catch up with the world at large.
Even if some works of lasting value have been produced,
as is undoubtedly the case, this period has in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
actuality represented a mere reflex of European musical
civilization, a surface agitation, to be followed by
an authentic and original national productivity along
the lines of its own needs and ideals.</p>

<p>So irregular and tumultuous have been the conditions
of musical development in America, that early
influences have been of relatively small qualitative importance
in determining the ultimate issues of American
music. There are but two such early influences of
importance to record, and one of these has become
wholly negligible with relation to our independent art
of music, finding its only resultant effect in the church
music of America. This, attributable in the first instance
to the Netherland school of the Renaissance, appeared
as the early English contrapuntal school of
Purcell, becoming associated with the music of the
Protestant Church in England, and finally becoming
diluted to the productions of the school of Billings and
Hopkinson in America. American hymnology undoubtedly
owes its character to this evolutionary sequence,
although in the end American church music
has become inundated with the German influence in its
more sentimental aspects, and presents in general a
profound degeneration too momentous for discussion
in the present brief review. The one great original
influence acknowledged by the nation, in its musically
creative life, is the mighty German tradition of the
epoch of Beethoven. It is significant and fortuitous
that America was colonized, musically, at the time
when the influence of that tradition was paramount in
the world. It was the emigrating German music
teacher, in every city and town of the United States,
who implanted the fundamental conception of musical
art in American civilization. Accepted and consulted
everywhere, he determined the character of music in
America in the period of reconstruction and educational
expansion after the Civil War. His influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
was solidified by the character of symphonic and choral
enterprise, and by that of the performances of German
musical artists touring in America. The Italian was
the accredited opera singer and nothing more; the
German was the teacher.</p>

<p>In the subsequent course of developments, two matters
have militated against the ultimate domination of
the German influence in American composition. One
is the extensive change which has since occurred in
the racial nature of the population. Continued immigration
from all lands has eventually produced a population
too diverse to accept and perpetuate, as its
dominant musical character, the tradition of any one
nation, however musically great. The other is the
amazing musical awakening of all Europe since the
epoch of Beethoven, and especially since Wagner, and
the consequent deluge of modern music from various
nations which has poured in upon American musical
life. In view of the infinity of newly revealed possibilities,
the American composer has been unwilling to
continue to reflect merely the one tradition with which
his nation was formerly acquainted, in howsoever high
honor that tradition was held. It is to be said, however,
that the substantial character of German formal
musical construction has exerted, as it should, a permanent
influence upon the American attitude toward
composition, and one which is certain to operate beneficially
upon the creative musical life of the nation.
The American point of departure has been one not
so much of technical system and ideals generally, as of
temperament.</p>

<p>A third matter qualifying this emancipation of
American music is the unearthing of the mass of aboriginal
folk music peculiar to America, particularly that
of the Indian and the negro. This has had a far more
significant and widespread influence upon composers
in America than critics in general have been willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
to admit, and many of the strongest works now appearing
in this country acknowledge an influence from
these sources.</p>

<p>The 'American folk-song' discussion arose after what
has been termed the classical period of American music,
of which J. K. Paine may be considered the founder,
and during the period in which the romantic influence,
culminating in the work of MacDowell, was
beginning to yield to the influence of the ultra-moderns.
The factors which broke the exclusive German domination
in America were, on one hand, the following up
on this side of the water of the musical individuality
gained by other European nations, and, on the other
hand, the movement for the development of aboriginal
folk-song in America. To these causes, some may add
a spontaneous climatic influence, but of this there has
as yet been no material demonstration.</p>

<p>The gist of the folk-song discussion was the question
as to whether the basis of a characteristic national
American musical art was to be found in the music of
the negroes or Indians. This discussion arose after
Antonin Dvořák's proclamation of such a possibility
during his sojourn in America in the years 1892-95,
and rose to its height several years after the foundation
in 1901, by the writer, of The Wa-Wan Press, a
movement for the attainment of a greater freedom in
American music along both modern European and
American aboriginal lines. As in all such matters, the
question was answered by the degree and quality of
creativeness in the works brought forward in exemplification
of the principle. Good works on Indian or
negro themes have lived, and bad ones have died. It
soon became plainly evident that there was no popular
prejudice against music drawing upon the characteristics
of these native aboriginal sources; on the contrary,
much interest was evinced, as has frequently
been shown by the attitude of audiences listening to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
such works and by the popularity which certain of
them have attained. The subject has also been made
one for special study by numerous musical clubs
throughout the country. What was asked was merely
that the result should be good music. The influence
of Indian and negro music upon American composition
has thus spontaneously come to be recognized as a
national and acceptable one, and the reflection of it
by American composers to-day arouses scarcely a murmur
of comment. That only a certain proportion of
composers in America would respond to these influences
was soon perceived, and with the readiness of
the people to accept this kind of work, it became merely
a question of the proportion of American musical art
which should exhibit these tendencies. There appears
to be no diminution of the tendency of many composers
to draw upon these apparently inexhaustible aboriginal
sources, and with the constant advance of creative
musical art in America, and with its eagerness to press
to a conclusion every available phase of music susceptible
of development, there is every reason to believe that
this influence, now generally recognized, will lead to a
very considerable mass of achievement of a high character.
America is too diverse in its sympathies and
ideals to acknowledge any one national or racial influence
as paramount in its musical art, but absolute creative
freedom is essential to its national character.</p>

<p>Upon the original German influence, which has been
rapidly modified in America by the work of Wagner
and Strauss, there has followed chiefly the influence of
modern France. Many American composers have lent
themselves with avidity to the assimilation of the new
technical resources revealed by Debussy and his colleagues,
with excellent results so long as they considered
these merely as accretions to their previous resource,
but in general with equal failure where they
have thought to create in the spirit of the French idiom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
The directness of Russian musical expression has made
its appeal to American composers, though its influence
upon the color of American music has been inconsiderable
in comparison with the French. The one cumulative
effect of the many influences, from within and
without, which have qualified the nature of American
music, especially during the last two decades, has been
to wrench it free from the uninspiring and nationally
inappropriate character which it had acquired as the
result of its original exclusive early German influence,
without, it is to be noted, leading it into imitative
subservience to the particular character of the musical
art of any other nation. In other words, America has
gained its creative musical freedom, even if still too new
to that condition to manifest its ultimate results. With
this widened horizon, the true creative epoch of American
music has only now begun. The handful of American
composers of serious ideals and noteworthy ability
who could be named a few years ago has increased
to scores, and new names appear in such rapid succession
that the fairly definite knowledge which America
had of its chief composers of the 'classical' and 'romantic'
epochs can give only the feeblest conception of the
present condition of composition in America. The best
of the newer work shows a loftiness of ideals, a breadth
of outlook, a definiteness of purpose, a freshness of
color, a sense of the beautiful and an <em>esprit</em> which argue
strongly for the future honor of American music.
The chief danger which threatens the American composer
is the tendency to accept and conform to the
standards of the centres of conventional and fashionable
musical culture, especially in unsubstantial modern
aspects, and to fail to study out the real nature
and musical needs of the American people. Such a
tendency naturally lingers with the lingering domination
of Europe over the standards and the machinery
of American musical life. Conformity means representation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
and a certain sort of acclaim for the composer;
nonconformity means severance from the usual
and conventional centres and institutions of musical
culture. Critical approbation does not mean the response
of the people; the composers most highly acclaimed
by the critics can by no means be said to have
come closest to touching the national heart. The attitude
of the world of musical 'culture' in America is still
cold toward the native producer; this narrow American
'culture' world pays for the maintenance of fashionable
foreign standards, and resents any interference with
this course. Concert singers are seldom heard in
American songs worthy of their artistry, and orchestral
conductors seldom give, on their own initiative,
successful native orchestral works, an isolated performance
of which has been arduously procured elsewhere.</p>

<p>With the people generally, however, the matter is
quite otherwise. The people of the nation have never
shown a disposition to receive otherwise than cordially
the work of their own composers. From Stephen Foster,
through the ranks of popular music composers, to
MacDowell, to many song composers of the present,
and latterly to the composers of music for popular
festivals and pageants—wherever the composer has
gone directly to the people and served their needs,
whether in the sphere of lesser or greater ideals, he
has found a ready welcome and a hearty response.
The pathway of true creativity, of healthy growth and
achievement for the composer in America to-day, lies
in abandoning the competition with European sensationalists
and ultra-modernists in the narrow arena of
the concert halls of 'culture', and turning to the fulfilment
of national needs in the broadest and deepest
sense.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of this matter is linked with
the third and last general division of our main subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
the question of administration. As a natural consequence
of events in American musical history, dating
from the earliest days, there has arisen the so-called
'musical world' of America to-day, the well-defined
national system of concert, recital and operatic life.
This system arose normally to supply the new world
with the products of the highly developed musical art
of the old, and in such a capacity it has admirably
served its purpose. In the course of time, however,
and with the increasing wealth and musical culture of
America, the harvest to be reaped by the commercial
exploitation of foreign artists has not remained unperceived
by a country not naturally backward in the perception
of commercial advantage. It is quite natural
that those who took into their hands the management
of these affairs should seek the greatest profit
which they could be made to yield. This, it will readily
be seen, was not to come from the broad development
of a given locality, which would involve education and
a departure from the centres of wealth, but from the
exploitation of the narrow circle of wealth and culture
which existed in every community of importance.
Thus a great circuit was established throughout the
country, by which a process of skimming the cream
from as many communities as possible was set in operation,
in the presentation of famous foreign artists to
what has been allowed to pass as the American public.
Thus a system established originally as a service to the
people has finally degenerated to the condition of a
commercial enterprise which is utterly without regard
to the broader interests of the people. The true condition
of affairs is made evident to-day by the fact that
when a resident of any moderate-sized prosperous
American city starts to inaugurate some local musical
enterprise for the benefit of the whole community, and
calling for the entire community's support, he learns
that the concert and recital life of his city, its 'musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
world,' reaches and is supported by but from three to
five per cent. of the entire population. The other
ninety-five to ninety-seven per cent. find the regular
musical events beyond their means, as well as beyond
the facts of their culture, though in the latter respect
America is now rapidly learning that the enjoyment of
the best music is far less dependent upon special education
than has commonly been supposed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, by phonograph and player-piano, by
newspaper and magazine, by high-class municipal concerts
and occasional chance glimpses into the world
of greater musical possibilities, the mass of the people
have begun to become awakened to the existence of
the larger musical world which they do not see and the
larger musical life which they do not share, and to
crave participation in it. Finally, therefore, we have
the spectacle of an American 'musical world' which is
no longer true to American conditions and which
does not serve the people. In short, we have finally
come face to face with the problem of the reaction of
musical art and democracy.</p>

<p>With this question the nation has of late begun
to deal in no half-hearted or uncertain manner. In
fact, the national response to this situation involves
the greatest American musical movement of the day.
In its earlier phase the question asked was: Will the
people, under democracy, rise to the accepted standards
of musical culture? A negative answer to this question
has been generally entertained, and among cultured
people it has been commonly supposed that democracy
would drag down the standards of musical culture.
That a wholly new and multifold phase of musical life
would arise to meet the requirements of a civilization
such as that of America seems to have been earlier suspected
or foreseen only by a few thinking students of
conditions, who recognized the fact that the exact meeting
of the mass, as it became more enlightened, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>
the conditions of traditional musical culture was not
the solution which was to be expected or even desired.
The plain fact was that the people at large were not
enjoying the benefits, the pleasure, recreation, or inspiration,
as the case might be, of all that the world
prizes as music in any of its forms above that of popular
songs and dances. Neither the educational system, on
the one hand, nor the cultural system, on the other, provided
them with it. One merely gave a little elementary
training of the most primitive sort, and for a short
time, to children, and the other did not reach beyond
the extremely restricted sphere of culture and wealth.
A movement was needed which should bring music in
all of its forms directly to the masses of the people,
and in the nation-wide campaign for what may be
termed 'music for the people' such a movement has
arisen. Experiments on every hand have shown that
the people have needed only to be brought in contact
with the higher forms of music, under advantageous
conditions, to rise spontaneously to the enjoyment of
it. The movement, in its activities, has assumed no
particular form, but has taken a variety of forms according
to the possibilities of local conditions. The
'Forest Festival,' or 'Midsummer High Jinks,' of the
Bohemian Club in San Francisco, while not open to
the general public, has nevertheless shown the potent
appeal of outdoor musical dramatic festivals to a large
number of persons not commonly in touch with musical
life. Municipal concerts on a scale not hitherto
attempted, such as those in Central Park, New York,
presenting not band, but orchestral concerts of the
world's greatest music, have met with an astonishing
and enthusiastic response on the part of the masses
who have hitherto had no opportunity of hearing anything
above the popular music of the streets, the dance
halls, and the 'movies.' The musical phase of the social
centre movement has assumed vast and national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span>
proportions, making use of the public school halls for
concerts and recitals for thousands of persons who
were previously without musical opportunities. Certain
towns, such as Bethlehem, Pa., Lindsburg, Kans.,
and the towns of the 'Litchfield County Choral Union,'
Conn., have established choral enterprises which include
in the choruses practically the entire population.
In two years the custom of Christmas trees with music,
free to the people, has become almost a national movement.
The 'community chorus,' such as that established
in Rochester, N. Y., with a membership of nearly
one thousand drawn from the people at large, and
singing in the public parks and school halls, should
prove a desirable form of people's musical enterprise
in many places. Standard symphony orchestras in
various cities are branching out extensively in the direction
of giving concerts involving the highest order of
music to the people at popular prices, and in some
cities the organization of symphony orchestras for popular
price concerts is threatening the existence of the
regular orchestra. And well-nigh surpassing in significance
most other phases of the general movement, and
certainly in their popular inclusiveness, are the pageants
or 'community dramas' with music, which are now
constituting a feature of community life throughout the
country.</p>

<p>If, then, the appreciative epoch along the older lines,
is concluded in America, it may be said that the nation
is coming to a new appreciation of music, as a
whole, in its relation to humanity. The new movement
will call forth new and larger efforts on the part of
American composers, who, with their present thorough
assimilation of the various musical influences of the
world, will lead the nation into a new and mature
creative epoch.</p>

<p>Whatever else the American music-lover may be, he
is decidedly not chauvinistic. Deprecatingly he is wont
to speak of native artistic accomplishment, and, however
much he may be disposed to vaunt the stellar
achievements of our few great opera houses and orchestras,
he is content to draw a veil of modest silence
over that part of our musical history which precedes
the advent of those <em>de luxe</em> organizations. Hence it is,
perhaps, that the searchlight of the historian has played
but fitfully upon the early musical life of America—for,
although popular interest may not inspire the writing of
history, it is not without its influence on the publication
thereof. Possibly the musical life of pre-Revolutionary
America has had little to do with shaping the
ultimate artistic destinies of the nation, yet it formed
the matrix into which our subsequent musical culture
has been embedded and as such it is of both interest
and importance to those who would follow a phase of
our national development, as yet regrettably neglected.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar tendency of the American historian to
lay the foundation of our national history squarely on
the Rock of Plymouth. A solid foundation, truly, but
not a very broad one. The predominant influence of
New England in the industrial and commercial development
of the United States can hardly be gainsaid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
That its influences on the country's æsthetic development
have been equally predominant is questionable.
More especially in musical matters are we inclined to
call it into dispute. If we might judge from American
popular music, we should be disposed to infer that
such influences as may have been active in the shaping
of it came chiefly from the South. Nor is popular
music a negligible criterion in this respect, for in it
have always lain the germs of truly national art. Of
course, our knowledge of the state of musical culture
in the early colonies does not enable us to say definitely
and dogmatically just where and how American musical
development first began. It will probably appear
eventually that the early musical life of the colonies
has had very little to do with our musical culture of
to-day. But, purely as a matter of historic justice, it
might be pointed out that unqualified statements, such
as the assertion of Ritter that 'the first steps of American
musical development may be traced back to the
first establishment of English Puritan colonies in New
England,' are, to say the least, somewhat premature.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A consideration of music among the Indians is not
germane to our present purpose. As far as we are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>concerned Indian music is an exotic, and it is only of
recent years that American composers have turned to it
in a conscious search for national color which is, perhaps,
the first real symptom of aspiration toward characteristically
national expression. From the point of
view of musical history the development of American
music must be considered as beginning among the first
white settlers on these shores, and it may be said at once
that those beginnings, like Guy of Warwick's death, are
still 'wrop in mystery.' Regarding musical life in the
colonies before the year 1700 our information is so
slight as to be negligible. For almost a century preceding
that year white men—many of them men of culture—had
been settled in America.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That these men
completely forgot the art in which so many of them
found pleasure, and in which at least a few of them
must have possessed some skill, is a supposition too
absurd to be seriously entertained. As to the nature
and proportions of their musical activities we have no
exact evidence and, in default of such, it is necessary
for us to dip a little into comparative history.</p>

<p>In England the curtain of the seventeenth century
rose on a country that as yet knew not cropped heads
nor Geneva cloaks nor steeple-crowned hats nor the
snuffling drone of Hop-on-High-Bomby mournfully
mouthing the sinfulness of the flesh and the menace
of the wrath to come. England still deserved its old-time
appellation of 'merrie.' It still ate and drank,
sang and swore, bussed and wantoned blithely, lustily,
as befitted a country with a full purse, a sound constitution,
and a healthy indifference to the disturbing subtleties
of theology and metaphysics. It was a robust,
Falstaffian England, still unregenerate, still addicted to
sack and loose company, but with a mind as clearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>keen as a Sheffield blade and a heart as soft and impressionable
as its own Devonshire butter—'pitiful-hearted
butter that melted at the sweet tale of the
sun.' In short, a normal, vigorous, able-bodied, human
country, not yet soured by the virus of an acidulated
Puritanism, nor devitalized by the distemper of a cultivated
licentiousness; a country in whose fertile soil
the seeds of art might well germinate and flourish
apace. And, as a matter of fact, English music, like
English drama and poetry, was then approaching the
culmination of its golden age. In Italy, Palestrina had
just died; Peri and Monteverdi were shaping the beginnings
of opera; the madrigal, the mystery, the morality
and the masque were the prevailing media of secular
musico-literary expression, while popular instrumental
music was represented by Pavans, Galliards, Allmains,
Courantes, and other courtly-sounding forms. The
stern, strict god of polyphony was already stooping to
flirt with the light and wayward muse of the people,
making the first tentative advances toward a union
from which was destined to spring a seductively human
art. Never since has England stood so high musically
among the nations of Europe. Never since has she
produced composers who so closely rivalled the greatest
of their contemporaries. There was William Byrd
'a Father of Musicke,' as the Cheque-book of the
Chapel Royal has it—one of the most learned contrapuntists
of his time and unequalled by any of his contemporaries
in compositions for the virginals. There
was John Dowland, 'whose heavenly touch upon the
lute doth ravish human sense.' There was Orlando
Gibbons, one of the greatest composers of his period,
who was then in the beginning of his distinguished career.
These, and many other English composers of
scarcely lesser note, were as highly honored abroad as
they were at home. Their influence on the development
of German music has been admitted even by German<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
critics.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In England the madrigal flourished then as it
did nowhere else in Europe and reached a degree of
perfection hitherto unattained even by the best madrigalists
of Italy and the Netherlands. What Peri and
Monteverdi were doing successfully in Italy in the
pseudo-Grecian music-drama, the English were attempting
to do, more characteristically though less successfully,
in the masque. Some of the most famous of
English popular songs—like 'The Bailiff's Daughter of
Islington,' 'The Three Ravens,' and 'Drink to Me Only
with Thine Eyes'—have come down to us from that
period. Indeed, the musical vitality of the England of
that time was truly remarkable, and thousands of madrigals,
motets, anthems, ayres, and ballets remain as
eloquent witnesses to its teeming fecundity. English
instrumentalists were then rated the best in Europe
and were as commonly employed in the courts of Germany
as German instrumentalists are now employed in
the restaurants of London.</p>

<p>Nor was this noteworthy musical activity confined to
the small class of professional musicians. If we may
believe Morley,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and read aright the references of
Shakespeare and other contemporary writers, music
was sedulously practised by all classes in England,
from the sovereign to the beggar. Queen Elizabeth, we
find, played excellently on the virginals and the poliphant,
though it does not appear that her dour successor
took very kindly to such exercises. It seems to
have been a matter of course that every well-reared
girl should sing at sight and play acceptably on the
virginals, the flute, and the cittern. Sight-reading—alas
for our degenerate days—was apparently a universal
accomplishment, at least among people of the better
classes. After viols were introduced, every gentleman's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>house contained a chest of them and the chance visitor
was expected to take his part at sight in the impromptu
concerts which were a favorite form of social
diversion. 'Tinkers sang catches,' says Chappell, 'milkmaids
sang ballads; carters whistled; each trade, and
even the beggars had their special songs; the bass-viol
hung in the drawing-room for the amusement of waiting
visitors; and the lute, cittern, and virginals, for the
amusement of waiting customers, were the necessary
furniture of the barber-shop. They had music at dinner;
music at supper; music at weddings; music at
funerals; music at night, music at dawn; music at
work; music at play.'</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>From this intensely musical England came the band
of colonists who landed at Jamestown, Virginia, in
1607. About half of them were 'gentlemen' and the remainder
were soldiers and servants. The proportion of
gentlemen—'unruly gallants,' as Capt. John Smith calls
them—was less in later emigrations, though it was always
comparatively high. Many soldiers came, and
some convicts and young vagrants picked up in the
streets of London were sent out as servants. Starvation,
disease, and the attacks of Indians left very few
survivors among those who came to Virginia during
the first ten years. Afterward the population grew
very rapidly and contained, on the whole, representative
elements of all classes in England, with a comparatively
large proportion of the upper classes. In 1619,
as we learn from a statement of John Rolfe, quoted in
John Smith's 'Generali Historie,' the first negro slaves
were introduced into Virginia. A description in the
'Briefe Declaration' shows Virginia about two years
later as a country already in the enjoyment of peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
and prosperity. 'The plenty of these times,' says the
writer, 'unlike the old days of death and confusion,
was such that every man gave free entertainment to
friends and strangers.' About that time land was laid
out for a free school at Charles City and for a university
and college at Henrico, but the project was not
then carried through. As yet, however, there was not
any pressing demand for public educational advantages,
as the proportion of children was still very
small. Later years saw a great increase in the population,
both native and English born. During the Civil
War there was a large exodus from England of cavaliers,
as well as merchants, yeomen, and other substantial
people, who found the troubles at home little to
their taste or profit. There must have been little to
distinguish the Virginia society about the middle of
the seventeenth century from English society of the
same period. The colonists lived well; they were prosperous;
they had good, substantial houses equipped
with good, substantial English furniture; they entertained
with open-handed freedom and generosity.
'The Virginia planter,' says George Park Fisher, 'was
essentially a transplanted Englishman in tastes and
convictions and imitated the social amenities and culture
of the mother country. Thus in time was formed
a society distinguished for its refinement, executive
ability and generous hospitality for which the Ancient
Dominion is proverbial.'<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The population of Virginia always remained largely
rural, but nevertheless there was social life aplenty.
Education was mainly in the hands of the clergy, who,
as a rule, were Englishmen of culture. But steps
toward public education were taken at a very early period.
The attempt of 1621 failed, as we have noticed,
but in 1635—three years before John Harvard made his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>bequest—Benjamin Syms left an endowment for a free
school in Virginia. This, to quote a recent writer, 'was
the first legacy by a resident of the American plantations
for the promotion of education.' Another free
school was established in 1655 by Captain Henry King,
and two in 1659 by Thomas Eaton and Captain William
Whittingdon. In 1670, according to a report from Sir
William Berkeley to the Commissioners of Foreign
Plantations, the population of Virginia consisted of
40,000 persons, of whom 2,000 were negro slaves and
5,000 white servants. The 2,000 negro slaves probably
included a number of mulattoes, for even then there
must have been traffic between white men and negro
women, as we may infer from the law which gave to a
child the status of its mother. The remainder of the
population was almost exclusively English. What we
have said of Virginia in the seventeenth century applies
also in a general way to Maryland and Carolina,
both as to population and conditions, though the
Huguenot emigration to Carolina in 1685 made a decided
difference in the character of the population
there subsequent to that date.</p>

<p>This brief incursion into general history has been
made, not to prove anything, but to bring forward a
few facts which may be found suggestive. The Southern
colonists during the seventeenth century were predominantly
English people of the first and second generations.
They were fairly representative of contemporary
English society, though the proportion of 'gentlemen'
was higher among them than at home. They
came, as we have seen, from a country where music was
practised enthusiastically by all classes. It is preposterous
to think that in the new country they discarded
their musical tastes like a worn-out garment. There
is no reason why they should have done so. After the
first years of famine and turmoil and death they were
comparatively peaceful and prosperous. There were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
among them, it is true, a certain number of stern-faced
Puritans, melancholy preachers of the sinfulness of
pleasure; but on the whole the attitude of the Southern
colonists toward life was that of the gay, gallant, laughter-loving
cavaliers. There is little doubt that these
same gallant gentlemen kept up in the colonies that
devotion to the <em>joyeuse science</em> for which they had
been famed since the days of Cœur de Lion. In the
announcements of the early concerts at Charleston in
the first half of the eighteenth century we find that
the orchestra was often composed in part of neighboring
gentlemen, who were good enough to lend their
services for the occasion, or sometimes that certain
gentlemen, of their courtesy, obliged with instrumental
or vocal selections. Whence we may infer that the
custom of keeping a chest of viols in his house for the
use of his family and his guests, so generally observed
by the English gentleman at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, was still honored by the colonial gentleman
at the beginning of the eighteenth.</p>

<p>The cultured colonists followed English fashions very
closely in all things, and the music they played was
doubtless the music in vogue in London drawing-rooms
and concert halls. The humble colonists, presumably,
were less concerned with the mode, and sang and
played the old English tunes which they and their
fathers and their grandfathers had brought across the
sea. American historians have taken for granted, with
a good deal of smug complacency, that there was no
real musical life among these people. The assumption
seems to be based—if it has any basis—on the fact that
the population of the South was preëminently rural.
But that there was little urban life does not mean that
there was little community life. On the contrary, life
in the South was much more intimately gregarious
than is usual in towns and cities, and it is in hospitable
social gatherings rather than in stiff-backed attendance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
at concerts and operas that the musical soul of a people
finds real expression. Furthermore, the Southern
colonists had a communal consciousness, as we may see
from their early essays in public education, and it is
probable that this consciousness expressed itself in
other ways of which we have no evidence. The
churches brought them together, also, perhaps for social
as well as religious gatherings. It is, indeed, a
plausible surmise that musical reunions of some sort,
apart from purely private entertainments, were not unknown
to them.</p>

<p>The music of the colonial proletariat was English,
that of the gentlefolk largely so. Among the common
people this music may have undergone some alteration
in the course of time, and certain gifted ones among
them may have made original music of their own. We
can conceive that the gentlefolk occasionally occupied
themselves with musical composition, and some of their
efforts, perchance, percolated through the classes and
became the property of all the people. We cannot say,
but it is possible; it is even probable. If English music
did not undergo a change in Virginia and Maryland
and Carolina, we can be sure that it altered somewhat
in the hands of the pioneers who carried it to Kentucky,
to Missouri, to Texas. One hears in the Southwest
many quaint, characteristic old songs and tunes
of unmistakably English origin. We can safely assume
that by the time they reached Missouri and Texas
from England they had absorbed quite a little local
color.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that the music of the American
negroes is the music of the English colonists strained
through the African temperament; or perhaps we
should say the African temperament strained through
the music of the English colonists. In any case, Afro-American
music is a blend, and the mixing, we may
suppose, began with the beginning of slavery in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Southern colonies. The negro slaves were an ignorant,
impressionable people set down in the middle of a
white civilization from which they naturally and immediately
began to absorb the things that were appreciable
to their senses. The most easily appreciable,
perhaps, of these things was music, and such music
as the negroes heard among the white people they absorbed
and, to some extent, assimilated.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Just how much all this has to do with American music
we cannot say, any more than we can say just what
is American music. National music, we take it, is the
composite musical inheritance of a people, molded and
colored by their composite characteristics, inherited
and acquired. And the music of the South is undoubtedly
part of the musical inheritance of the American
people. How much of that inheritance we have rejected
and how much retained will not appear until
some historian arises with enough scholarship to analyze
our musical heritage in detail; with enough
genius in research to trace its elements to their sources;
and with enough patriotic enthusiasm to lend him patience
for the task. In the meantime, surface conditions
fail to justify the arbitrary ruling out of the South
as an utterly negligible factor in our musical development.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In approaching the history of the New England
Puritans one is in danger of making serious mistakes,
due to temperamental prejudices and to a misconception
of the Puritan attitude toward life. The term
Puritan itself is more or less indeterminate, covering
all sorts and conditions of men with a wide diversity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>of views on things spiritual and temporal.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> There is
a very general impression, totally unsupported by historic
evidence, that the Puritans frowned intolerantly
on every worldly diversion, including music. Many of
the zealots did, it is true—in every movement there are
extremists—and the general trend of thought was influenced
somewhat by their thunderous denunciations of
all appearance of frivolity. In such circumstances the
average human being, uncertain how far he may safely
go, is inclined to avoid the vicinity of danger and
seek the haven of a strictly negative attitude toward
everything about which may hang the very slightest suspicion
of impropriety. We have many instances in
history of this same tendency. The early Christians,
taking Christ's warning against the world and the
flesh in its most extreme literalness, adopted a course
for avoiding hell and gaining heaven which, if consistently
followed, would soon have left the world barren
of any beings from whom the population either of
heaven or of hell might be recruited. We are apt,
however, to exaggerate the self-denying habits of the
Puritans. On many points of conduct and dogma they
were fiercely and uncompromisingly intolerant. Their
Sabbath observance was strict to the point of absurdity.
But in general they were not disposed to deprive the
world of innocent pleasure.</p>

<p>The New England Puritans were more or less of a
piece with their English brethren, and we have every
evidence that the latter tolerated music, even cultivated
it with assiduity. Milton's love of music is well
known.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> John Bunyan, a typical lower-class Puritan,
speaks of it frequently and appreciatively in the 'Pilgrim's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Progress.' 'That musicke in itself is lawfull,
usefull and commendable,' says Prynne in his 'Histrio-mastix,'
'no man, no Christian dares deny, since the
Scriptures, Fathers and generally all Christian, all Pagan
Authors extant do with one consent averre it.'
Even the anonymous author of the 'Short Treatise
against Stage-Playes' (1625) admits that 'musicke is a
cheerful recreation to the minde that hath been blunted
with serious meditations.' Not only Cromwell, but
many other Parliamentary officers, including Hutchinson,
Humphrey, and Taylor, were sincere devotees of
the art. Colonel Hutchinson, one of the regicides, 'had
a great love to music,' according to the 'Memoirs' of
his wife, and often diverted himself with a viol, 'on
which he played masterly; he had an exact ear and
judgment in other music.' In the retinue of Balustrode
Whitelocke, who was sent by Cromwell as ambassador
to Queen Christina of Sweden in 1653, were two persons
included 'chiefly for music,' besides two trumpeters.
Whitelocke himself was 'in his younger days a
master and composer of music.' On one occasion, during
his stay at the Swedish court, the queen's musicians
'played many lessons of English composition,' and on
another occasion, after the ambassador's party had
played for her, Christina declared that 'she never heard
so good a concert of music and of English songs; and
desired Whitelocke, at his return to England, to procure
her some.'</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical music was indeed vigorously suppressed,
but solely for reasons touching the propriety
of its employment in the worship of God. Outside the
churches the Puritans showed no particular objection
to the art. In fact, the practice of music was common
enough among them, if we are to believe the statement
of Solomon Eccles, a professional musician, who was
successively a Presbyterian, an Independent, a Baptist,
and an Antinomian, and always found it easy to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
a living by his profession. Notwithstanding the ban on
theatres, public operatic performances were inaugurated
in London in 1656 and were continued without
interference. The publishing of music flourished under
the Commonwealth as it never did before in England,
and large collections of Ayres, Dialogues, and
other pieces remain to us from that period. Such
activity in music publishing could have been stimulated
only by a corresponding demand, and a demand
for printed music could not have co-existed with a neglect
of musical practice.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>However, we must not jump to the conclusion that
the American Puritans were as freely inclined to the
practice of music as their brethren across the sea. As
a matter of fact, they had no musical life whatsoever.
There are some points in the psychology and condition
of the New England colonists which may help to
explain this seeming anomaly. A large proportion
of the people of England were Puritans merely because
it was not safe or convenient for them to be anything
else, and they changed their moral and theological
complexions just as soon as a change in fashion rendered
the transformation desirable. Many of the most
prominent members of the Parliamentary party were
drawn into the movement more through political ambition
or democratic ideals than for religious reasons.
Cromwell's famous 'Trust in God and keep your powder
dry' might well express the mental attitude of more
than a few of them. Even among the religious leaders
were a goodly number whose only desire was to reform
what they considered the ritualistic abuses in the English
church of their time and who had not the slightest
ambition to suppress the harmless pleasures of life or
the ordinary manifestations of human instincts. The
New England Puritans, on the other hand, were a select<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
group of people who were driven across an inhospitable
ocean to the barren shores of a strange land
by the indomitable zeal of their convictions, the stern
intractability of their consciences and the adamantine
obstinacy of their independence. They were not Puritans
merely in externals; they were Puritans to the
core. Their view of life was uncompromisingly serious.
The world was not to them a place for dalliance;
it was a place for work, for the earnest sowing of seeds
that might bring forth a harvest of grace and godliness,
a harvest worthy to be garnered by the Master into His
eternal storehouse. So, however kindly they may have
looked upon music, they could not conscientiously have
allowed it to engage much of their attention. They
could with consistence postpone the gratification of
their musical tastes to the next world, where, for all
eternity, the practice of music would be their chief
occupation. Besides, the life of the first settlers in
New England was not such as to encourage any indulgence
in unnecessary relaxation. What with the stubborn
barrenness of the soil, the ferocity of the Indians,
and the extreme inclemency of the climate, they had
little opportunity for the cultivation of those gentler
arts toward which by taste and temperament they were
not, in any case, very strongly inclined.</p>


<p>And, indeed, from such information as we are able
to gather on the subject, it would appear that the practice
of music, even in its simplest forms, was practically
unknown to the New England Puritans before the end
of the seventeenth century, though some of the Leyden
colonists, according to Winslow, were 'very expert in
music.' Out of the forty-odd psalm tunes in use among
the Pilgrims only five were generally known to New
England congregations a generation later, and, even of
these five, no congregation could ever perform one
with any approach to unanimity. 'In the latter part of
the seventeenth and the commencement of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
centuries,' says Hood, 'the congregations throughout
New England were rarely able to sing more than
three or four tunes. The knowledge and use of notes,
too, had so long been neglected that the few melodies
sung became corrupted until no two individuals sang
them alike.' The Rev. Thomas Symmes, in an essay
published in 1723, tells us that 'in our congregations
we us'd frequently to have some people singing a note
or two after the next had done. And you commonly
strike the notes not together, but one after another, one
being half-way thro' the second note, before his neighbor
had done with the first. This is just as melodious
to a well-tuned musical ear as Æsop was beautiful to
a curious eye.' 'It's strange,' he comments further on,
'that people that are so set against stated forms of
prayer should be so fond of singing half a dozen tunes,
nay one tune from Sabbath to Sabbath; till everybody
nauseates it, that has any relish of singing.' In fact,
the reverend gentleman confesses that if anything could
drive him to Quakerism or Popery it would be the style
of singing in vogue among his co-religionists. John
Eliot, son of the Indian apostle, in an essay published
in 1725, says that 'often at lectures, and especially at
ordinations, where people of many congregations met
together, their ways of singing are so different that
'tis not easy to know what tune is sung, and in reality
there is none. 'Tis rather jumble and confusion. Altho'
they all doubtless intend some tune or other, and,
it may be, the same, yet they differ almost as much as
if, everyone sung a different tune.' The effect must
have been delightful. Samuel Sewall, who was precentor
of his church for twenty-four years, makes the
following plaintive entry in his diary for February 6,
1715: 'This day I set Windsor tune, and the people at
the second going over into Oxford, do what I could.'
Under date of February 23, 1718, he writes: 'I set York
tune, and the congregation went out of it into St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
David's in the very 2nd going over. They did the same
three weeks be.' Certainly the vocal efforts of the
New England saints must have been excruciating when
they moved the Reverend Thomas Walter to declare
that the singing of his congregation 'sounded like five
hundred different tunes roared out at the same time.'
It is almost unbelievable that people of intelligence, as
most of the early New Englanders were, should be so
utterly callous to ear-splitting discords of that kind,
but the testimony of their own pastors puts the matter
beyond doubt.</p>

<p>Now much of this extraordinary chaos in the congregational
singing of the seventeenth century New
England colonists was probably due to the prevailing
doubt as to whether singing was, after all, quite proper
to the worship of God. Until well into the eighteenth
century the propriety of singing psalms in church was
a subject of heated controversy. John Cotton published
a tract in defense of the custom in 1647 ('Singing
of Psalms a Gospel Ordinance'), and, as late as
1723, a number of clergymen published a tract called
'Cases of Conscience about Singing Psalms, briefly considered
and resolved,' in which we find the proposition:
'Whether you do believe that singing Psalms, Hymns
and Spiritual Songs is an external part of Divine Worship,
to be observed in and by the assembly of God's
people on the Lord's Days, as well as on other occasional
meetings of the Saints, for the worshipping of
God....' Those who had taken singing in church as
a matter of course, and had made of it such a cacophantic
horror as is described by Eliot, Walter, and others,
characteristically championed their own style of singing,
which they called 'the old way,' and zealously opposed
any attempt to sing by rule as a step toward
Popery.</p>

<p>But, apart from all differences of opinion upon
church singing as such, no people who were in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
habit of practising music, even in the most elementary
way, could make such a hopeless mess of ensemble
singing in unison, when the tunes were so old and familiar
and the number of them so limited. Ensemble
singing by a mixed gathering of untrained people is
likely to be pretty bad in any case, but even among a
heterogeneous and untutored crowd there are always a
number whose accuracy of ear and intonation suffices
to keep the others more or less close to the melody—especially
when it is a familiar one. Among New England
colonists, however, the ability to sing must have
been about as common as the ability to dance on the
tight rope. The Rev. Thomas Symmes assures us that
he was present 'in a congregation, when singing was
for a whole Sabbath omitted, for want of a man able
to lead the assembly in singing.' Certainly the good
people of that congregation on the whole must not
have counted singing among their diversions—if they
had any. We have no ground for stating flatly that
the New Englanders of the seventeenth century absolutely
abstained from singing on all occasions; but if
they did sing it was in a most primitive and haphazard
fashion.</p>

<p>Instrumental music certainly was taboo to them. As
far as we know there was not a musical instrument
in New England before the year 1700. If there was, it
has shown remarkable ingenuity in escaping detection.
Before leaving this world for a better one, the New
England colonist was meticulously careful in making
out a full and exact inventory of his material possessions.
He told in painful detail just how many pots
and pans, bolsters, pillows, tables and chairs he had
been blessed with and in just what condition he bequeathed
them to posterity. Nothing detachable in the
house was too small nor of too little value to escape
his conscientious enumeration. But of musical instruments
the testamentary literature of New England contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
no mention. The first suggestion we find of the
existence of such a thing is a laconic reference in the
diary of the Rev. Joseph Green under date of May 29,
1711: 'I was at Mr. Thomas Brattle's, heard ye organs
and saw strange things in a microscope.' We have no
means of knowing, unfortunately, what were the musical
qualities of Mr. Thomas Brattle's 'organs'; perhaps
they were as strange as the things the reverend diarist
saw in the microscope. Anyhow, as far as we can discover,
they were unique in New England. Perhaps
they were the same that Mr. Brattle bequeathed to the
Brattle Square Church of Boston in 1713. The congregation
of the church did not 'think it proper to use
the same in the public worship of God,' and the instrument
was consequently given to King's Chapel, where
it was introduced in the services, to the consternation,
anger and disgust of Dr. Cotton Mather and the greater
part of the population of New England. This organ
is still preserved for the benefit of the curious, and,
though its musical possibilities apparently were limited,
it at least marked a precedent which, as we shall
see in a later chapter, was followed by good results.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that most of the New England
congregations, at the end of the seventeenth century,
knew not more than five psalm-tunes. Those, it is
assumed, were the psalms called 'Old Hundred,' 'York,'
'Hackney,' 'Windsor,' and 'Martyrs.' The early Pilgrims,
presumably, were more eclectic. They used the
volume of tunes compiled by the Rev. Henry Ainsworth,
of Amsterdam. The version of Sternhold and Hopkins
was used in Ipswich and perhaps elsewhere. In
1640 both the Ainsworth and the Sternhold and Hopkins
versions were generally superseded by the 'Bay
Psalm Book,' though Ainsworth's psalter was retained
by the churches of Salem and Plymouth for some time
longer. The 'Bay Psalm Book' was compiled by a number
of Colonial clergymen, including Rev. Thomas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Weld, Rev. John Eliot, of Roxbury, and Rev. Richard
Mather, of Dorchester. It is interesting chiefly as containing
some of the quaintest verses ever written.
Thus:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'And sayd he would them waste; had not<br>
Moses stood (whom he chose)<br>
'fore him i' the breach: to turn his wrath<br>
lest that he should waste those.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>and again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'Like as the heart panting doth bray<br>
after the water-brooks,<br>
even in such wise, O God, my soule<br>
after Thee panting looks.' </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The settings of the tunes in the New England psalm-books
were those of Playford and Ravenscroft, but, as
we have seen, the congregations habitually introduced
original harmonizations of their own. The general
method of singing those psalms was known as 'lining
out.' That is to say, the minister or deacon first sang
each line, to give the key, and the congregation followed
his lead—more or less. The results of this system
were often ludicrous. For instance, there is the
well-known example, cited by Hood, where the deacon
declares cryptically:</p>


<p class="center p11">'The Lord will come and he will not,'</p>


<p>and follows this up with the perplexing injunction:</p>



<p class="center p11">'Be silent, but speak out.'</p>


<p>Owing to the efforts of John Cotton and other cultured
clergymen the people as a whole soon came to accept
singing as proper to divine service, but many decades
passed before they could be persuaded that the
cultivation of the voice or the use of any outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
means to acquire skillfulness in singing was decent or
godly. Not to the outward voice, they argued, but to
the voice of the heart did God lend ear; and, though
their singing was verily as the bellowing of the bulls
of Bashan, it mattered not except to the ears of their
neighbors, who, in truth, must have been sufficiently
calloused to the discord of harsh sounds. This peculiar
attitude lasted until well into the eighteenth century.
Even as late as 1723 the 'Cases of Conscience,'
to which we have referred, contained such questions
as:</p>

<p>'Whether you do believe that singing in the worship
of God ought to be done skillfully?' and 'whether
you do believe that skillfulness in singing may ordinarily
be gained in the use of outward means by the
blessing of God?' By the efforts of enlightened clergymen
like Mather, Symmes, Dwight, Eliot, Walter, and
Stoddard the people of New England were finally
brought to a realization of the fact that their praise
would be just as acceptable to God if offered on the
key; but their conversion was a slow and painful process.
Two decades of the eighteenth century had passed
before they began to pay any attention to the cultivation
of church music, and, as we shall see in the next
chapter, this awakening interest coincided with the
first faint stirrings of a general musical life in the Puritan
colonies.</p>

<small>THE BEGINNINGS OF MUSICAL CULTURE IN AMERICA</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot p2b">

<p>Composite elements of American music—New England's musical awakening;
early publications of psalm-tunes; reform of church singing—Early
concerts in Boston—New York, Philadelphia, the South—The American attitude

Billings and their contemporaries.</p>
</div>


<p>The whole history of early musical culture in America—obscure
enough at best—is additionally obfuscated
by the persistent illusion of American historians that
the New England psalm-tunes formed the absolute
basis of our musical development. This illusion may
be part of the widespread impression that the church
has been the exclusive <em>fons et origo</em> of musical art.
Thus Ritter: 'Musical culture in America, as in the great
musical countries of Europe—Italy, France, Germany—took
its starting point from the church.'<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> As a consequence
of this view of things we find the early chapters
of all existing histories of American music strewn with
'psalm-tunes,' 'church choirs,' and 'clergymen,' as
thick as autumn leaves in Vallombrosa. All of which
would be perfectly desirable if the importance of these
factors in our musical development were apparent.
Neither in our popular music nor in works of our serious
composers can we trace the influence of New England
psalmody, though we can trace the influence of
German folk-songs and Scotch reels and Irish jigs and
negro tunes and the writings of every European composer,
from Bach to Brahms.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>
<p>We have no desire to belittle the achievements of
New England or the magnitude of its part in the history
of the country. But—owing perhaps to the fact
that literary production in America was for many generations
confined almost exclusively to the New England
states—we have had imposed on us a habit of
thought which is a sort of historical synecdoche—New
England being the figurative whole. Of course, it does
not make a particle of difference to American music
what we may think or say about its parentage. But,
as long as history is to be written, it is well that it
shall be written with some attempt at a disinterested
attitude, and assumptions that the genesis of our music
lay in New England or in any other circumscribed
locality are entirely <em>ex parte</em>. Most of our composers
have been disciples of some recognized European
school or eclectic students of several schools. We can
point in them to the influence of Bach or Mozart, of
Beethoven or Brahms, of Schubert, Mendelssohn or
Grieg, of Wagner, Strauss or Debussy, just as we can
point to such influences in the writings of every European
composer, great or small. The musical inheritance
of the American composer is not American; it is
universal. For a variety of reasons we have not yet
developed a distinctively national school, but, among
our younger composers who are unmistakeably American,
where are the traces of Puritan psalmody? The
<em>ethical</em> influence of Puritanism is still strong in the
land; it still colors our literature, art and public life;
it even colors our music. But purely æsthetic influence
is quite a different thing. Frankly, we believe that the
music of colonial New England has had no more influence
on our music of to-day than the writings of
Cotton Mather have had on the work of O. Henry.</p>

<p>These prefatory remarks are made simply to emphasize
the fact that the following sketch of the beginnings
of musical culture in New England and elsewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
is intended only as a statement of historical
facts and not as an argument for the influence of the
New England colonies, or of any other colonies, in the
development of American music. Little information
is obtainable concerning the musical life of America
before the end of the eighteenth century, and in these
early chapters we are merely trying to arrive at an
approximate estimate of what that musical life may
have been, leaving philosophical deductions therefrom
to those skilled in the drawing of such. If a predominating
amount of space is given to the New England
colonies it is chiefly because our available information
concerning them is very much fuller than that which
we possess concerning the rest of the country.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>We have already seen that up to the end of the seventeenth
century there were not, as far as we can discover,
even the most elementary attempts at a musical
life in New England. The writer of 'Observations
Made by the Curious in New England,' published in
London in 1673, remarks that there were then in Boston
'no musicians by trade.' It is to be assumed that
there were none elsewhere in New England. The installation
of Mr. Thomas Brattle's organ in King's
Chapel forty years later necessitated the importation
of a 'sober person to play skillfully thereon with a loud
noise.' This person was a Mr. Price, who appears to
have been the first professional musician in New England.
He was followed by Mr. Edward Enstone, of
England, who came over as organist in 1714. To augment
his salary of £30 a year, Mr. Enstone, on Feb. 21,
1714, filed a petition 'for liberty of keeping a school as
a Master of Music and a Dancing Master,' but the petition
was 'disallowed by ye Sel. men.' In the Boston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
'News Letter' of April 16-23, 1716, the same Mr. Enstone
inserted the following explicit advertisement:</p>

<p class="small1">"This is to give notice that there is lately sent over from
London, a choice Collection of Musickal Instruments, consisting
of Flageolets, Flutes, Haut-Boys, Bass-Viols, Violins, Bows,
Strings, Reads for Haut-Boys, Books of Instructions for all these
Instruments, Books of ruled Paper. To be Sold at the Dancing
School of Mr. Enstone in Ludbury Street near to Orange Tree,
Boston.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Note.</span> Any person may have all Instruments of Musick mended, or
Virginalls and Spinnets Strung and tuned at a reasonable Rate, and likewise
may be taught to Play on any of those Instruments above mentioned;
dancing taught by a true and easier method than has been heretofore.'"</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Enstone was a person of versatility. Apparently
he triumphed over 'ye Sel. men,' and, in addition to
this gratifying fact, we may infer from his advertisement
that musical instruments were used to an extent
in Boston prior to 1716. If Mr. Enstone's consignment
were the first he would hardly have failed to mention
it. He is exhaustively informative. The allusion to the
mending of musical instruments also suggests that already
they were not uncommon. 'Virginalls and Spinnets'
were strung and tuned by Mr. Enstone, though
they were not included in his imported collection. We
have been unable to discover any information which
would throw light on the extent to which musical instruments
were used in New England during the first
half of the eighteenth century. Even toward the end
of the century their use was not very common. But
probably they were used to some extent among people
of culture as early as the year 1700, and to an increasing
extent as time advanced and old prejudices weakened.</p>

<p>Among the people at large the most potent factor in
developing a musical life was the formation of singing
societies for the cultivation of a proper method
of singing psalms. This reformation had long been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
advocated by the most enlightened clergymen of the
colony. Prominent among them was the Rev. Thomas
Symmes, who thus interrogatively argues his cause:</p>

<p>'Would it not greatly tend to promote singing of
psalms if singing schools were promoted? Would not
this be a conforming to <em>scripture pattern</em>? Have we
not as much need of them as God's people of old?
Have we any reason to expect to be inspired with the
gift of singing, any more than that of reading? Or to
attain it without suitable means, any more than they
of old, when <em>miracles</em>, <em>inspirations</em>, etc., were common?
Where would be the <em>difficulty</em>, or what the disadvantages,
if people who want skill in singing would
procure a skillful person to instruct them, and went
two or three evenings in the week, from <em>five</em> or <em>six</em>
o'clock to <em>eight</em>, and spend the time in learning to sing?
Would not this be an innocent and profitable recreation,
and would it not have a tendency, if prudently
managed, to prevent the expense of time on other occasions?
Has it not a tendency to divert young people,
who are most proper to learn, from learning <em>idle,
foolish</em>, yea <em>pernicious songs</em> and ballads, and banish
all such <em>trash</em> from their minds? Experience proves
this. Would it not be proper for <em>school masters</em> in
<em>country parishes</em> to teach their scholars? Are not they
very unwise who plead against learning to sing by
rule, when they can't learn to sing at all unless they
learn by rule? Has not the grand enemy of souls a
hand in this who prejudices them against the best
means of singing? Will it not be very servisible in
ministers to encourage their people to learn to sing?
Are they not under some obligation by virtue of their
office to do so? Would there not, at least in some
places, appear more of that fear of man, which brings
a snare, than of true Christian prudence in omitting
this? And, as circumstances may allow, would it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
be very useful and profitable if such ministers as are
capable would instruct their people in this art?'</p>

<p>The introduction of Satan as the protagonist of unskillful
singing is an ingenious and appropriate touch.
One might infer from the allusion to idle, foolish and
pernicious songs and ballads that the young people
of New England were not unlike young people of less
godly places and expressed their feelings in ways that
might have shocked their proper elders. If they did,
it is a pity that some of their songs and ballads have
not come down to us, be they never so pernicious. The
advice of the Rev. Mr. Symmes, however, appears to
have been followed, for we find that about the year
1720 singing societies began to sprout in various parts
of New England. At first these were concerned exclusively
with church music, but the elementary musical
training they afforded was helpful in developing
a capacity for the practice and appreciation of other
music.</p>

<p>The growth of singing societies naturally created a
demand for some sort of musical literature and inspired
the publication of many books of psalm-tunes
and instructions. This demand was anticipated as
early as 1712 by the Rev. John Tufts, pastor of the
Second Church in Newbury, who published in that year
'A very Plain and Easy Instruction to the Art of Singing
Psalm tunes; with the Cantos or Trebles of twenty-eight
Psalm tunes, contrived in such a manner as that
the Learner may attain the Skill of Singing them with
the greatest ease and speed imaginable.' About two
years later he published 'An Introduction to the singing
of Psalm Tunes, in a plain and easy method. With a
collection of Tunes in Three Parts.' The essence of
the 'plain and easy method' seems to have been the
substitution of letters for the customary musical notation,
together with lessons 'to assist in Raising and
Falling of notes either gradual or by leaps, the groundwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
of all good singing, and is not to be obtained
ordinarily without help of some Skilful Person, or of
an Instrument.' 'But being attained and observing
the few foregoing Rules,' the reverend author continues
encouragingly, 'you will be able to leap with your
voice from one note to another, as they occur in various
distances, and with a little practice to sing all tunes
in this book, or other prick'd after this method in all
their parts, with ease and pleasure.' The tunes and
their arrangements were taken by the Rev. Mr. Tufts
from Playford's 'Book of Psalms.'</p>

<p>In 1721 the Rev. Thomas Walter, of Roxbury, Mass.,
published a book comprehensively entitled 'The
Grounds and Rules of Musick explained. Or an introduction
to the Art of singing by Note: Fitted to the
meanest capacity. By Thomas Walter, A.M. Recommended
by Several Ministers.' As illustrating the Rev.
Mr. Walter's qualifications to explain 'the Grounds and
Rules of Musick' we would quote the following delightful
and illuminating disquisition: 'There are in Nature
but <em>seven distinct sounds</em>, every eighth Note being
the same. Thus when a tune is sung by another upon
a Key too low for the Compass of my Voice, if I will
sing with the Person, it must be all the Way, <em>eighth
Notes</em> above him. I naturally sound an Eighth higher.
So a Woman naturally strikes eighth notes above the
grum and low sounding Voice of a Man, and it makes
no more Difference than the singing of two Persons
upon an Union or a Pitch. So, on the contrary, when
we sing with a Voice too High and shrill for us, we
strike very naturally into an Octave or Eighth below.
And here let it be observed that the <em>Height</em> of a note
and the <em>Strength</em> of singing it are too different Things.
Two notes of equal Height may be sounded with different
degrees of Strength so as that one shall be heard
much further than the other.' This book has the honor
of containing the 'first music printed with bars in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
America,' Mr. Tufts having omitted in his works the
bars marking the measures.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The arrangements were
taken from Playford.</p>

<p>In 1741 Dr. Watts' 'Psalms' were printed in Boston,
and an edition of Watts' 'Hymns' were printed in the
same year by Dr. Franklin in Philadelphia. The next
important publication was a part of Tansur's collection,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
which was printed by William Bailey at Newburyport,
Mass., in 1755, under the title of 'A Complete
Melody in Three Parts.' In 1761 there was published
in Philadelphia a large work called 'Urania, or a
Choice Collection of Psalm-Tunes, Anthems and
Hymns. From the most approv'd Authors with some
entirely new: In Two, Three and Four Parts. The
Whole peculiarly adapted to the use of Churches, and
Private Families. To which are prefix'd the Plainest
and most Necessary Rules of Psalmody. By James
Lyon, A.B....' Three years later appeared in Boston
'A Collection of the best Psalm Tunes, in two, three
and four parts; from the most approved authors, fitted
to all measures, and approved by the best masters in
Boston, New England; the greater part of them never
before printed in America. Engraved by Paul Revere,
printed and sold by him and Jos. Flagg.' In his preface
Flagg, with admirable patriotism, pointed out that,
though most of the tunes in his book came from across
the Atlantic, the paper on which they were written
was of American manufacture; and he hoped that the
fact would recommend his book 'even to those who
have no peculiar relish for the music.' We shall have
more to say of Flagg in a later chapter. Daniel Bailey,
of Newburyport, published in 1764 'A new and complete
Introduction to the Grounds and Rules of Music in two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>books,' of which the first is taken from Williams and
the second from Tansur. In 1769-71 Bailey issued a
two-volume work called 'The American Harmony.'
The first volume is a reprint of Tansur's 'Royal Melody,'
together with 'A new and correct Introduction to
the Grounds of Musick, Rudimental, Practical and
Technical,' also taken from Tansur. The second volume
is a reprint of Aaron Williams' 'New Universal
Psalmodist.'<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Most of the music in the collections of Lyons, Flagg,
and Bailey was the work of contemporary English
church-composers. Some of it may have been written
by Americans, but there has been identified only the
anthem called 'Liverpool,' in Lyon's collection, which
is the work of William Tuckey, of New York. This is
only pseudo-American, however, as Tuckey was an
Englishman. It is merely an imitation of the weak
style of verse anthem then popular in England, and
the same is true of the other compositions which may
be American. Notwithstanding the poor quality of the
music, the success of Bailey's collections serves to show
the advance which church singing must have made in
New England. The florid 'fuguing choruses' and canons,
popular among the hymn-writers who followed
Purcell in England, were not very noble or inspiring
music, but their performance entailed a degree of musical
expertness far removed from the cacophantic
crudity of which the Rev. Thomas Symmes and his
contemporaries so plaintively spoke. At the same time
it may be pointed out that these early collections of
psalm-tunes are full of errors, due to the lack of persons
competent to read proofs of musical works, and,
if the leaders of church choirs were not musicians
enough to correct such errors in the rendering, either
their ears were yet imperfectly trained or they had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>sense of free harmony far in advance of their age.
Furthermore, it was very late in the eighteenth century
before the reform in church singing became general
throughout New England. In the 'History of
Worcester' we read of an energetic duel on August 5th,
1779, between the old deacon and the singers, in which
the deacon read the psalm according to the 'lining-out'
method, while the choir simultaneously sang the verse
without pause, according to the new system. Force
of numbers and noise finally overpowered the doughty
old champion of tradition, who, we are informed, 'retired
from the meeting-house in tears.' It was as late
as 1785 before the parish of Rowley joined the march
of progress, as we find the following entry under that
date in the 'History of Rowley': 'The parish desire the
singers, both male and female, to sit in the gallery and
will allow them to sing once on each Lord's day without
reading by the deacon.'</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>We may assume that musical culture made noticeable
progress in New England in the second half of
the eighteenth century. Among the mass of the people
it remained somewhat primitive, but among the cultivated
classes in Boston and the larger cities the best
contemporary music was heard frequently and with
appreciation. As we shall see in a later chapter, public
concerts were held in Boston at least as early as
1731, and they seem to have compared favorably with
similar functions in European cities. But of musical
life in the intimate sense there was still comparatively
little. Brissot de Warville writes from Boston in 1788:
'You no longer meet here that Presbyterian austerity
which interdicted all pleasure, even that of walking,
which forbade travelling on Sunday, which persecuted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
men whose opinions were different from their own.
The Bostonians unite simplicity of morals with that
French politeness and delicacy of manners which render
virtue more amiable. They are hospitable to
strangers and obliging to friends; they are tender husbands,
fond and almost idolatrous parents, and kind
masters. Music, which their teachers formerly proscribed
as a diabolical art, begins to make part of
their education. In some houses you hear the forte-piano.
This art, it is true, is still in its infancy; but
the young novices who exercise it are so gentle, so complaisant
and so modest, that the proud perfection of art
gives no pleasure equal to what they afford.'</p>

<p>There were at that time very few pianos in New England
and we find from the newspaper advertisements
that the teacher usually lent his own piano to his pupils
for practice. We have it on the authority of Mr. Elson
that the efforts of the pupils were customarily confined
to Gyrowetz, or to 'Washington's March,' 'The
Battle of Prague,' or the <em>Sonata pour le Clavecin ou
Forte-piano, qui représente la bataille de Rossbach.
Composée par M. Bach</em>—not the majestic Johann Sebastian,
of course. Ritter has copied the following titles
from a manuscript book of the late eighteenth century:
<em>Ça Ira</em>, 'White Cockade,' 'Irish Howl,' 'French March,'
'Hessian Camp,' 'Duchess of Brunswick,' 'Duetto' by
Mancinelli, 'Water Rice,' 'Nancy of the Mill,' 'O Bessy
Bell,' 'German Spaw,' 'Ossian's Ghost,' 'Duke of York's
March,' 'Duetto,' by Dr. Arne, 'Every Inch a Soldier,'
'Quick March of the Twenty-sixth Regiment,' 'March,'
'Poor Soldier,' 'Sound Alarm,' 'When Nichola first to
court began,' 'Sweet Village of the Valley,' 'Minuetto,'
'Dead March in Saul,' 'Bright Phœbus,' 'Ode to Harmony,'
'Swedish Air,' 'Quick March,' 'King of Sweden's
March,' <em>Marche des Marseillais</em>, 'Hessian Air,' 'Baron
Steuben's March,' 'Prince Frederick's March,' 'Sonata<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
from Minuetto in Samson,' 'March in Joseph,' 'Trio' by
Humphrey.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to note some of the secular music
published in New England at that time. We find
the following advertisement in the 'Columbian Centinel'
of Boston in 1798. 'Just published, price one dollar,
neatly bound and lettered, sold by E. Larkin, No.
47, Cornhill, "The Columbian Songster and Free Mason's
Pocket Companion." A Collection of the newest
and most celebrated Sentimental, Convivial, Humorous,
Satirical, Pastoral, Hunting, Sea and Masonic Songs,
being the largest and best collection ever published in
America. Selected by S. Larkin.' In the same year
there appeared in Northampton, Mass., 'The American
Miscellany.' From the foreword of the ingenuous editor
we learn that in this work 'a general preference has
been given to American productions, and perhaps nothing
will more effectually exhibit the progress of the
human mind in the refinements which characterize the
age, than the songs which, from general consent, are
now in vogue.' The exhibit is not very complimentary
to the 'progress of the human mind.' Most of the songs
contained in these collections are flatly commonplace,
many of them are cheap and tawdry in the extreme.
It would hardly be fair to look upon such publications
as reflecting the musical taste of the cultured class in
New England. Just what proportion that class bore to
the total population we cannot say. We can safely assume,
however, that the concerts given in Boston and
elsewhere during the second half of the eighteenth century
fairly indicate the taste of the musical elect in
New England. The citation of a few programs in this
place will, consequently, not prove amiss.</p>

in Boston, gave a concert there on the 19th May,
1801, which included two overtures, four concertos (for
clarinet, violin, bass and oboe, respectively), six solo
vocal pieces and one duet!</p>

<p>No doubt these concerts show that the musical taste
even of cultured New England was somewhat indiscriminate.
But the tendency to serve strangely mixed
programs was not confined to America. We find, too,
that concerts were very frequently a medium for the
exploitation of compositions by the concert givers or
their friends. This custom was not confined to America
either, nor was it confined to the eighteenth century.
On the whole, and considering all the circumstances,
the concert life of New England speaks well for the
musical culture of its people. The same may be said
of concert-life elsewhere in America. Unfortunately
our information concerning general musical culture in
other parts of the country is extremely scanty, but we
may assume that the inhabitants of the Middle and
Southern colonies enjoyed a fuller musical life than
was possible in New England, where it was retarded by
conditions that were not operative elsewhere. In Pennsylvania,
it is true, Quakerism must have exercised a
repressive influence, though, from the evidence at our
disposal, we find that Philadelphia at the end of the
eighteenth century was more advanced musically than
any other city in America. Practically our only
sources of information concerning early musical life
in New York, Philadelphia and the South are the records
of operatic and concert performances, and, while
we shall speak of those activities more fully in later
chapters, we may be pardoned for referring briefly to
them here.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In New York English opera was heard perhaps as
early as the year 1702, but performances did not become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
common until about 1750. After the production
of the 'Beggar's Opera' in the latter year 'all the most
popular ballad-operas,' to quote Ritter,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> 'successively
appeared on the New York stage. Besides these most
of the musical farces, melodramas, pantomimes, which
proved successful in London, were also produced in
New York.' Concerts became increasingly common
in the second half of the century and some of the programs
were remarkably interesting. By way of illustration
we quote the following program of a concert
given on the 9th February, 1770, for the benefit of Mr.
Stotherd:</p>


<div class="block1">

<p>In January, 1770, a large part of Handel's 'Messiah'
was given in New York for the benefit of William
Tuckey, with the assistance of 'a considerable number
of ladies and gentlemen.' The program of a concert
given by gentlemen of the army and navy in April,
1782, reads:</p>

<p>Of course, all the concerts given in New York were
not on an equally high plane. Many of them were
frankly popular and many mixed judiciously the popular
with the serious. A large proportion of these were
given at Vauxhall, Ranelagh, Columbia and other public
gardens where it was necessary to cater to the taste
of an assorted assemblage. On the whole, however, the
musical taste of the New York public was remarkably
good. Haydn seems to have been the favorite composer
of the time and after him we notice most frequently
the names of Pleyel, Handel, Corelli, Gossec,
Stamitz, Gyrowetz, and Bach.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The musical life of Philadelphia during the second
half of the eighteenth century was apparently richer
than in any other American city. There are no records
of public concerts there before the year 1757, but after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>that date they became so suddenly common and maintained
such a relatively high standard that the musical
soil in which they grew must have been extremely fertile—notwithstanding
the Quakers. Indeed, the musical
taste of the Philadelphians seems to have been at
once more eclectic and more discriminating than that
of the citizens of Boston and New York. Besides
Haydn, Pleyel, Handel, and the rest we find in their
programs the names of Grétry, Boccherini, Viotti,
Kreutzer, Paesiello, Sacchini, Cimarosa, Piccini, Gluck,
and Mozart.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The programs were much less mixed
than was customary in Boston and New York. We find
fewer comic numbers and fewer songs to Mars and
Bacchus, to larks and pining hearts and sighing
breezes. And quite as much consideration was shown
to the native American composer as is shown by the
concert-givers of to-day. Consider the following program
of the first Uranian Concert, given at the Reformed
Church, in Race Street, on the 12th April, 1787:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>
<p>We may mention here the extraordinary Grand Concert
given at the Reformed Church in Race Street on
May 4, 1786, with a chorus of two hundred and twenty
and an orchestra of fifty. Of course, such concerts were
unusual in Philadelphia. Choruses of two hundred and
twenty and orchestras of fifty were not then common,
even in European capitals. But, as Mr. Sonneck has
observed, such undertakings were not possible 'without
a logical evolution of conditions,' and this concert
throws a very favorable light on musical conditions in
Philadelphia. Incidentally, we learn that nearly one
thousand tickets were sold for the event, a remarkable
showing for a city of about 40,000 people.</p>

<p>There was a very active musical life in the South during
the eighteenth century, and it was much more diffused
than in the Middle or New England colonies. A
peculiar feature of the public concerts in the South
was the frequency with which amateurs appeared as
performers. We find the vocal part in one concert
was taken by 'a gentleman who does it merely to oblige
on this occasion.' In the advertisement of another we
read that 'the gentlemen who are the best Performers,
both in Town and Country, are so obliging as to assist
... on this Occasion.' Again we notice the announcement
of a 'Concert of Vocal and Instrumental Musick
to be performed by Gentlemen of the place, for the
entertainment of all lovers of Harmony.' Such announcements
were common. Of course, amateurs
sometimes took part in concerts in the North, especially
before the Revolution. As a rule, they were gentlemen
of the king's army and navy, among whom the practice
of music seems to have been sedulously cultivated. But
it would appear that the proportion of practical amateur
musicians was much greater in the South than
elsewhere in America, and that fact alone speaks volumes
for the culture of the Old Dominion.</p>

<p>Charleston was beyond doubt the leading Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
city in musical matters. We know definitely that public
concerts were given there as early as 1732, and it is
quite probable that they were given earlier. In 1762
was formed the St. Cæcilia Society,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> an organization
devoted to the cultivation of the best in music. It was
the first musical society formed in America. The following
program, given on the 6th March, 1794, under its
patronage, will illustrate the taste of the people of
Charleston:</p>

<div class="block1 p11">

Glee, Mr. Chambers, Mrs. Chambers and Mr. West. </p>
</div>

<p>It is noteworthy to find a symphony of Mozart on
a program of March 9, 1797.</p>

<p>It would appear that the citizens of Baltimore were
not quite so refined in their musical taste as their neighbors
in Carolina. Nevertheless they enjoyed an active
musical life. Concerts of fair quality were common
enough, and we read also of such interesting things as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>the production in English of Pergolesi's <em>Serva Padrona</em>
in 1790.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Richmond, Petersburg,
Norfolk, Alexandria and elsewhere in Virginia
there were public concerts given at an early period.
Unfortunately there has not yet been unearthed much
documentary evidence which would throw light on the
early musical life of these cities. But from what we
know of Charleston and Baltimore and from our general
knowledge of conditions among the Southern colonists
we should be inclined to say that the Virginia
cities possessed a musical life quite creditable in proportion
to their size. The same is true of Savannah
and New Orleans. It must not be forgotten that, with
the exceptions of Charleston and Baltimore, no Southern
city had a population of more than ten thousand
people. Most of them had very considerably less. Obviously
it would be unfair to expect that they enjoyed
metropolitan conditions.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Enough, perhaps, has been said to show that the
American colonists were not the musical barbarians
they are so frequently and complacently pictured.
Of course, European writers visiting the colonies almost
invariably took occasion to incorporate in their
literary works slighting references to the state of culture
in America. The custom still obtains among literary
visitors to these shores. Since the time of Columbus,
apparently, it has been an unwritten law that European
travellers must speak slightingly of American culture,
just as American travellers must make uncomplimentary
remarks about European hotel accommodations
and transportation systems. Such comments are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>usually the result of a congenital incapacity to see more
than one thing at one time. As a rule they are accurate,
but they do not mean what they seem to mean. They
are sentences detached from their context. A statement
that there is no first-class symphony orchestra in
New York would have a very different significance
from a statement that there is no first-class symphony
orchestra in Oskaloosa—though both sound alike to
one who knows nothing about either New York or
Oskaloosa. Equally ridiculous are the well-meant attempts
to demonstrate the growth of our artistic stature
by drawing parallels between the musical activity of
the colonies and the musical activities of America to-day.
In 1750 the population of Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Richmond, and Charleston
combined was less than one hundred thousand, and
even as late as 1800 it was little over two hundred thousand.
If we are to be fair to the American colonists,
we must take into consideration the conditions under
which they lived, the youth of the country, its comparative
isolation from the old-established centres of culture,
the many and complex circumstances that operated
to retard its æsthetic development. And if we
take these things into consideration, we cannot fairly
persevere in our supercilious attitude toward the musical
life of eighteenth-century America.</p>

<p>There is another side to the picture, however. In
spite of the undeniable growth of musical culture
among the American people of the eighteenth century,
it cannot be said that music had a really intimate meaning
for them, that they had woven it into the web of
their lives, that they had found in it a necessary form
of expression. Art is created that way. It may be the
folk-song of an ignorant peasant or the symphony of
a Mozart or Beethoven. But always it is born of a
need for personal expression. Music was not personal
to the American colonists; it was still an exotic, a pleasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
supplied from outside sources, a diversion which
serious men might occasionally enjoy but to which they
could not afford to devote serious attention. Even
among a certain class of Americans of the present day
this attitude persists to some degree. Music is not yet
generally regarded as a profession for men. Men go
into business; they become brokers, lawyers, or politicians;
they even become newspaper reporters—but
not musicians. Music is still <em>par excellence</em> the avocation
of long-haired, libidinous foreigners. We may,
perhaps, without injustice trace this attitude to Puritan
New England. The aristocracy of the South had the
aristocratic point of view. Most Southern gentlemen
were practical musicians. They were not, of course,
professional musicians—gentlemen did not adopt professions,
except that of arms. But music had a certain
personal meaning for them. It was a graceful and elegant
medium for the expression of their gallant, romantic
and courtly sentiments. They could sing of arms
and the red glow of wine and the red lips of women—all
frankly important things in their lives, all supposedly
unimportant things in the lives of the upright New
Englanders. But, as a vehicle for the expression of
profound and fundamental emotions, music had no
meaning to them.</p>

<p>The aristocratic Southern point of view, however,
did not impress itself on the mass of the American
people; the New England point of view did. The psychological
effect of New England on the rest of the
country has been extraordinary. Certainly the New
Englanders were fond of music; they encouraged it;
they had considerable taste; they were glad to have
their daughters take music lessons—music was a thoroughly
ladylike accomplishment. When Priscilla
spilled the 'Battle of Prague' <em>con brio</em> over the 'forte
piano' her performance brought undiluted joy to the
parental heart. When Fil Trajetto played a concerto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of Corelli the more cultivated Bostonian could justly
appreciate the virtues of the composition and its performance.
The people of New England had relatively
as much taste and culture as the same class of people
elsewhere. Nevertheless they did not feel music as a
serious and necessary thing.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Such an attitude was most unfavorable to the growth
of a native art. During the eighteenth century there
were few native American musicians by profession.
In the South the professional musicians were chiefly
French, in the North chiefly English. As a consequence
there were few American composers. Of course, many
Americans manufactured music. Every civilized man
at some period of his life has composed a tune or a
poem or a play. It is as inevitable as the measles. The
American colonists did not escape the infection. Many
American compositions lie unidentified in the early
collections of hymns and anthems; many more undoubtedly
were denied even such an anonymous burial.
We have already alluded to William Tuckey, whose
anthem was included in the collection of James Lyon.
Tuckey was organist of Trinity Church, New York.
He has sometimes been called the first American composer,
and he would be did he not happen to be born
in Somersetshire, England. Many of Tuckey's contemporaries,
such as Flagg, and undoubtedly others
whose names have been forgotten, composed church
music in the style of the period—the weak, insipid, undistinguished
style of Tansur and Williams. We can
easily afford to forget their efforts.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few American composers of
this period whom we cannot afford to forget It is
really impossible to say who was the first American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
composer, but the right to the title seems to be divided
between Francis Hopkinson and James Lyon, natives
of Philadelphia and Newark, N. J., respectively. Certainly
they were the first of any importance. Hopkinson,
a lawyer, poet, musician, inventor, painter, and
signer of the Declaration of Independence, was one of
the most remarkable men of his time. He was born
in 1737, was graduated at the College of Philadelphia,
received the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor of
Laws from that institution and the degree of Master of
Arts, <em>gratiæ causa</em>, from the College of New Jersey.
After his admission to the bar he held a number
of public offices, became a delegate to the first Continental
Congress and was appointed by that body to
'execute the business of the Navy under their direction.'
He presided over the Admiralty Court of Pennsylvania
from 1779 until its jurisdiction became vested in the
United States and took an important part in the debates
of the convention which framed the Constitution.
We know little of his musical education, but the
most important part of it seems to have been guided
by James Bremner, while his taste was undoubtedly
polished by subsequent visits to Europe. He was an
able harpsichordist, we learn, and often deputized for
Brenner as organist of Christ Church. In spite of his
official duties he found time to promote musical education,
to give concerts and to participate in frequent
musicales at the home of Governor John Penn. His
inventive turn found expression in an improved method
of quilling a harpsichord, the application of a keyboard
to the harmonica and a 'contrivance for the perfect
measurement of time,' known as the Bell-harmonic.</p>

<p>The most important thing about Francis Hopkinson
from our point of view, however, is that his song 'My
Days Have Been so Wondrous Free,' dated 1759, is,
as far as we know, the earliest secular American composition
extant. It is included in a collection of songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
made by Hopkinson which contains also several other
specimens of his muse. They are pretty, simple, graceful,
and somewhat amateurish. Among them is an anthem
with figured bass—a rarity in early American
music. Possibly Hopkinson was editor and part author
of the 'Collection of Psalm Tunes with a few Anthems
and Hymns' published in 1763 for the use of Christ
and St. Peter's churches. He has been credited with
the authorship of one of the numerous 'Washington's
Marches,' though which of them he wrote—if he wrote
any—his sole and painstaking biographer<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> has been
unable to discover. Mr. Sonneck, however, has succeeded
in proving that he composed 'The Temple of
Minerva, a Musical Entertainment performed in Nov.,
1781, by a Band of Gentlemen and Ladies at the hotel
of the Minister of France in Philadelphia.' The music
of this piece, unfortunately, is not extant. A collection
of eight songs by Hopkinson, with accompaniments for
harpsichord or pianoforte, was published in Philadelphia
in 1788. Speaking of these Mr. Sonneck says:
'As a composer Francis Hopkinson did not improve
greatly during the twenty years which separate this
song collection from his earliest efforts. His harmony
is still faulty at times, and he possesses not an original
musical profile. To claim the adjective of beautiful
or important for these songs or his other compositions
would mean to confuse the standpoint of the musical
critic with that of the antiquarian. But even the critic
who cares not to explain and pardon shortcomings
from a historical point of view will admit that Hopkinson's
songs are not without grace and that our first
poet-composer obeyed the laws of musical declamation
more carefully than a host of fashionable masters of
that period. Artistically, of course, he resembles his
contemporaries. His musical world, like theirs, was an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>untrue Arcadia, populated with over-sentimental shepherds
and shepherdesses, or with jolly tars, veritable
models of sobriety and good behavior, even when filling
huge bumpers for drinking-bouts. Then again we notice
in Francis Hopkinson's music the studied simplicity
of that age for which treble and bass had become the
pillars of the universe. This and much more is antiquated
to-day. But why should we criticize at all our
first "musical compositions?" It becomes us better to
look upon these primitive efforts as upon venerable
documents of the innate love of the American people
for the beauties of music and as documents of the fact
that among the signers of the Declaration of Independence
there was at least one who proved to be a "successful
Patron of Arts and Sciences."'</p>

<p>It is a peculiar coincidence that in 1759, the same
year in which Hopkinson's first songs were written, an
ode, set to music by James Lyon, a student at Nassau
Hall, was performed at the college commencement.
This, perhaps the earliest of American commencement-odes,
is unfortunately not extant. Lyon was graduated
from Princeton in 1759 and took up his residence in
Philadelphia. There he seems to have founded or
taught in a singing school where one of his anthems
was performed in 1761—'an elegant anthem,' according
to the 'Pennsylvania Gazette.' In 1762 he received
the degree of M.A. from Princeton and perhaps wrote
the music for an entertainment entitled 'The Military
Glory of Great Britain' which was performed at the
commencement. Subsequently he was ordained a minister
in the Presbyterian church and preached the gospel
in Nova Scotia, Maine, and elsewhere until his
death in 1794.</p>

<p>We have already adverted to Lyon's 'Urania, or a
choice Collection of Psalm-Tunes, Anthems and Hymns
from the most approved Authors, with some entirely
new.' This collection exercised an important influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
on subsequent early American psalmodists.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The six
tunes marked as new were composed by Lyon. These,
together with settings of the 17th and 19th psalms, a
setting of one of Watts' lyric poems, 'Friendship,' and a
'Marriage Hymn,' are all the known works of Lyon still
extant. 'Their study,' says Mr. Sonneck, 'will induce
no critic to call Lyon a composer of real merit or even
a musician fully conversant with musical grammar.
His music, viewed from an æsthetic standpoint, is in
no way remarkable. He certainly gave his best in the
Hymn to Friendship, the minor movement of which
contains a few unexpected rays of beauty. This movement,
and the fact that Lyon energetically occupied
himself with music, when music was in its infancy in
colonial America, prove that he possessed some inborn
musical talent. For nobody will compose in a musical
wilderness, no matter how valueless the compositions
may be, if not forced to do so by latent creative powers.
Had Lyon been educated in England, Germany,
or Italy his talents would have developed to greater
advantage, and his name might figure in musical dictionaries,
these mausoleums of celebrity, none of which
to-day mentions him. But his importance lies not in
the sphere of æsthetics; it lies rather in the sphere of
retrospective history. Not the absolute, but the relative
merits of his music attract our attention. He was a
pioneer and thereupon rests his lasting glory.'</p>

<p>In 1746 was born in Boston a man who bore the undistinguished
name of William Billings. Billings was
a tanner by profession and a musician by instinct. It
is unfortunate that this pioneer American composer
should have become the butt of so much ridicule; yet
one must admit that he invited ridicule. There was
something ludicrous even in his personal appearance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>'He was somewhat deformed,' says Ritter, 'blind of one
eye, one leg shorter than the other, one arm somewhat
withered, and he was given to the habit of continually
taking snuff. He carried this precious article in his
coat pocket made of leather, and every few minutes
would take a pinch, holding the snuff between the
thumb and clinched hand. To this feature we must
add his stentorian voice, made, no doubt, rough as a
saw by the effects of the quantity of snuff that was continually
rasping his throat.'<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> His zeal continually outran
his discretion. Even in church his voice drowned
those of his neighbors. He was of the temperament
that cannot approve without giving three cheers. The
very titles of his works provoke a smile. For instance:</p>

<p class="center p2">

<p class="center p1b">Boston: New England, Printed by Edes and Gill.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless Hillings was an original genius with an
unaffected, fervent and sincere love of his art. His very
naïveté is refreshing in an age which artistic artificiality
had rendered almost sterile. Of musical knowledge
he possessed very little. What knowledge he had
he picked up himself from such limited sources as were
at his disposal. In the preface to his 'New England
Psalm-Singer' he confesses ingenuously: 'For my own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>part, as I don't think myself confined to any Rules for
Composition laid down by any that went before me,
neither should I think (were I to pretend to lay down
rules) that any who comes after me were anyways obligated
to adhere to them any further than they should
think proper: so in fact I think it is proper for every
composer to be his own learner. Therefore, upon this
consideration, for me to dictate or to prescribe Rules
of the Nature for others, would not only be very unnecessary
but also a very great Vanity.' Later he
frankly confessed the immaturity that dictated those
statements. He set himself more humbly to the study
of rules for composition and developed an enthusiasm
for counterpoint, of which he speaks in the following
terms: 'It has more than twenty times the power of
the old slow tunes; each foot straining for mastery and
victory, the audience entertained and delighted, their
minds surpassingly fluctuated, sometimes declaring for
one part and sometimes for another. Now the solemn
bass demands their attention—next the manly tenor—now,
the lofty counter—now, the volatile treble. Now
here—now there, now here again. O, ecstatic! Rush
on, you sons of Harmony!' Even the tremendous earnestness
of the man does not save this from being
funny. It is poor Billings' fate to be funny under nearly
all circumstances.</p>

<p>The 'New England Psalm-Singer' appeared in 1770.
It may be recalled that Beethoven was born in the same
year. Eight years later Billings published 'The Singing
Master's Assistant,' a revision of his first work, which
attained wide popularity in New England and was
known as 'Billings' Best.' Following came 'Music in
Miniature,' 1779; 'The Psalm-Singer's Amusement,'
1781; 'The Suffolk Harmony,' 1786; and 'The Continental
Harmony,' 1794. Besides these Billings published
singly a number of anthems and other compositions.
All of his works show a most primitive conception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the art of composition and a very hazy knowledge of
the rules of harmony and counterpoint. But they contain
melodic and rhythmic force and originality. Billings
could not write a good fugue, but he could write
a good tune. Many of his compositions became very
popular in New England. Although he had invited
Britain and the Colonies to join 'unanimously' when he
published his first collection, he was one of the most
fiery of patriots when the Revolution broke out. Nothing
could surpass the fierce ardor of his zeal. He expressed
in dynamic terms his love of country and contempt
for his enemies, and he called down all the wrath
of an omnipotent deity on his unworthy head if he
should ever prove untrue to Boston—meaning America.
What were written originally as psalm-tunes he had
no difficulty in turning into ringing patriotic songs.
Many of them were sung by the New England soldiers
throughout the war, and the tune known as 'Chester'
was a favorite with the Continental fifers.</p>

<p>Billings is said to have introduced the use of the
'pitch-pipe' into New England choirs—where it was
badly needed—and he is supposed to have been the
first in New England to use the violoncello in church.
According to Ritter, 'he is credited with the merit of
having originated concerts or musical exhibitions in
New England'; but concerts or musical exhibitions were
originated there before he was born. Billings' merit
is that he was the first musician of really independent
and original talent that America produced. He was
handicapped by lack of technical knowledge and lack
of a suitable <em>milieu</em>. He wrote some good tunes which
passed into the musical life of the people. He is a
noteworthy figure, but his importance is not overwhelming.</p>

<p>Among Billings' contemporaries may be mentioned
Oliver Holden, Andrew Law, Jacob Kimball, Jr., Samuel
Holyoke, Samuel Read, and Lowell Mason. None of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
these possessed much more musical knowledge than
Billings and all of them, with one exception, possessed
much less talent. Holden is known chiefly for his 'Coronation'
hymn, which is still popular. He published
'The American Harmony' in 1792. Law was the author
of a collection of anthems and hymns, besides some
compilations on musical theory. His taste was better
than the average of his time, but his information and
creative capacity were limited. One of his hymns,
'Archdale,' acquired wide popularity. There is nothing
particular to say about Kimball, Holyoke or Read.
They were of about the same stamp as Holden and Law—mediocre
writers of uninspired and conventional
psalm-tunes.</p>

<p>Lowell Mason stands out above the rest as a musician
in the truer sense of the word. The earnest valor with
which he combated the condition prevalent in the New
England churches, flooded with 'fugue tunes' in imitation
of the imported variety but devoid of any musical
value, must be recognized. He was a pioneer in the
work of substituting for this worthless stuff tunes at
once simple and noble, in accordance with the principles
of harmony, and symmetrical in form. Mason
was born in 1792, at Medfield, Mass., and died in 1872
at Orange, N. J. He went to Savannah, Ga., and divided
his time between banking and musical study
under F. L. Abell. In 1822 he returned to Boston and
published the 'Boston Handel-Haydn Society's Collection
of Church Music,' containing a number of his own
compositions. The most familiar of his tunes are probably
'Corinth' ('I love to steal a while away'), 'Cowper'
('There is a fountain filled with blood'), 'Bethany'
('Nearer, my God, to Thee'), 'The Missionary Hymn'
('From Greenland's Icy Mountains'), and 'Mount Vernon'
('Sister thou wert mild and lovely'). After 1827
Dr. Mason (the degree of Mus.D. was conferred on him
by New York University) took charge of the music in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
no less than three churches, but subsequently confined
his labors to Dr. Lyman Beecher's Bowdoin Street
Church, whither pilgrimages were soon made from all
over the country 'to hear the wonderful singing.' His
training of boys' voices particularly was a marvel to
his generation. Mason's educational work is indeed of
uncommon importance and will be touched upon in a
later chapter. With Professors Park and Phelps he
edited the 'Sabbath Hymn Book' (1858) and in 1830
he issued the 'Juvenile Lyrics,' said to be the earliest
collection of songs for secular schools published in
America.</p>

<p>Except for the rugged originality of the ludicrous
Billings, the opening of the nineteenth century had still
disclosed nothing of American composition that might
be considered other than commonplace. But at least
the pioneer work had been done with commendable
earnestness and under very real handicaps. The actual
achievements of pioneers are never very great, but the
value of their work is incalculable. To the pioneers of
American composition we can at least tender our respect
for the undoubted sincerity of their efforts.</p>

<p>Sources of information—Boston Concerts of the eighteenth century;

etc.; conclusion.</p>
</div>


<p>In our last chapter we spoke to some extent of concert
life in America during the eighteenth century, and
it may be well to complete the record here as far as
the information at our disposal will allow. The importance
of concerts as reflecting the musical culture of a
people can very easily be overestimated. At best, they
represent the taste of merely a small portion of the
community; at worst they serve simply as occasions for
social display and for the indulgence of various forms
of snobbery. It is very difficult at a distance to judge
a true from a false artistic life. For aught we know
to the contrary, the concerts of the American colonists
represented chiefly their ideas of what was socially
correct. On the other hand, we are equally justified
in assuming that these concerts reflected accurately the
musical taste of the people. The truth is that we must
accept the record of early concert life in America purely
for its historic interest. Such deductions as we may
draw from it must always be presumptive. On the
surface, as we have already said, it speaks well for the
state of musical culture in America of the eighteenth
century. It would be futile—perhaps disappointing—to
pry further into its possible significance.</p>

<p>A certain characteristic indifference to the importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
of historical remains has lost to us irretrievably
much documentary evidence that would be of great
value in compiling a complete history of music in
America. Of our earliest newspapers, such as the 'Boston
News Letter,' the 'New York Gazette,' the 'American
Weekly Mercury,' and the 'South Carolina Gazette,'
no complete files seem to have been preserved,
and there is an irritating poverty of other documents
that would supplement the information contained
therein or fill out such lacunæ as the lost numbers may
have left. For our information on early concerts in
America we are almost totally dependent on old newspaper
files. Even if these files were complete it would
not follow by any means that the information obtainable
from them would be exhaustive, for it is not probable
that the newspapers mentioned all the concerts
given. A few diaries and similar documents have been
discovered which throw a little added light on the subject,
but there still remain many dark corners.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>We cannot say when or where the first public concert
was given in America. The first of which we have any
record was advertised in the Boston 'Weekly News Letter'
of December 16-23, 1731. It was 'a Concert of
Music on sundry Instruments at Mr. Pelham's great
Room, being the house of the late Doctor Noyes near
the Sun Tavern.' Further than that we know nothing
about it. We find notices of other concerts at intervals
for several years, but nothing is said about the music
played or the people who took part in them. In 1744
a concert was given at the historic Faneuil Hall, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>had been built two years earlier and which was apparently
the favorite place for such functions until
about the year 1755, when it was supplanted by the
newly erected Concert Hall in Queen Street.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Most of the concerts at Faneuil Hall were given for
the benefit of the poor and were held, it would appear,
only by express permission of the selectmen. In 1755
we first notice concerts given for the benefit of private
individuals and presumably without the permission of
the selectmen. One was given for John Rice, organist
of Trinity Church, and several for Thomas Dipper, organist
of King's Chapel. We know nothing about these
concerts except that they consisted of 'select pieces by
the best masters.' It is possible that there existed from
about the year 1744 a musical organization of which a
Mr. Stephen Deblois was treasurer and which gave frequent
concerts. The minutes of the Boston selectmen
meetings, as reprinted in the 'Boston Town Records,'
contain an entry under date of Nov. 21, 1744, to the effect
that 'Mr. William Sheafe and a number of gentlemen
desire the Use of Faneuil Hall for a Concert of
Musick ... the Benefit arising by the Tickets to be for
the Use of the Poor of the Town....' On Dec. 12, it
was reported that 'the Selectmen received of Mr.
Stephen Deblois two hundred and five pounds five shillings
old Tenor being collected by a Concert of Musick
in Faneuil Hall for the Use of the Poor of the Town'—obviously
the same concert for which permission was
granted to 'Mr. William Sheafe and a number of gentlemen.'
In September, 1754, Stephen Deblois purchased
Concert Hall for two thousand pounds, with the
result that concerts immediately shifted there from
Faneuil Hall. Thomas Dipper, for whom so many
benefits were given, apparently had a hand in the organization,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
if there was one. We find an announcement
in January, 1761, that 'Mr. Dipper's Public Concert
will begin on Tuesday the 20th instant.' This suggests
that there may have been also a series of private
concerts for subscribers, as the term 'public' concert
was very unusual in Colonial times. We read in the
Boston 'News Letter' of April 29, 1762: 'The members
of the Concert, usually performed at Concert Hall, are
hereby notified that the same is deferred to the end
of the Summer months. And it is desired that in the
meantime each member would settle his respective arrearage
with Stephen Deblois, with whom the several
accounts are lodged for that purpose.' We are, in fact,
confronted with suggestions of a musical organization
which held a series of concerts for members and another
for non-members. Whether such an organization
existed or not, it is at least certain that Boston enjoyed
the luxury of subscription concerts as early as
1761.</p>

<p>The 'Massachusetts Gazette' of October 2, 1766,
advertised a series of concerts to begin on October 7,
and 'to be continued every Tuesday evening for eight
months.' The concerts were to be held at Concert Hall
and intending subscribers were referred to Stephen
Deblois. Beginning with the year 1770, several series
were given by William Turner, Thomas Hartley, and
David Propert, the latter promising in his announcement
selections 'out of Mr. Handel's oratorios' besides
'select pieces upon the harpsichord with accompaniment
compos'd by the most celebrated masters of Italy
and London.' W. S. Morgan also gave some concerts
immediately before the war. It had not yet become
customary to announce the programs in detail and we
are consequently in the dark as to the nature of most
of them. Some of the concerts apparently were merely
operas in concert form. An announcement of June
20, 1770, speaks of a vocal entertainment of three acts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
'The songs (which are numerous) are taken from a new
celebrated opera, call'd "Lionel and Clarissa."' In the
diary of John Rowe there is the following entry under
date of March 23, 1770: 'In the evening I went to the
Concert Hall to hear Mr. Joan read the Beggar's Opera
and sing the songs....'</p>

<p>We find, however, a very fine program announced
for May 17, 1771, by Josiah Flagg—the same of whom
we have already spoken as a prominent compiler of
psalm-tunes. Flagg was for many years a most conspicuous
figure in the musical life of Boston. Besides
publishing two good collections of psalm-tunes, he
founded and trained a militia band and was active in
promoting concerts of remarkably high quality. As
he was the first to publish programs we cannot well
compare his musical taste with that of his contemporaries,
but it is doubtful if the average concert of the
time rose to the level of the following:</p>


<div class="block1 p11">

Periodical Symphony  <span class="flright">Pasquale Ricci</span></p>
</div>

<p>The other concerts given by Flagg were of about the
same standard. He seems to have disappeared from
Boston about the year 1773. His most important successor
in the promotion of music in Boston was William
Selby, an Englishman, who came over as organist
of King's Chapel, Boston, in 1772, or perhaps earlier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Selby threw himself into the musical life of his adopted
country with an enthusiasm for the cause which seems
always to have been exclusively confined to foreigners.
He played and taught the harpsichord and organ, composed
prolifically, promoted concerts of fine quality,
and was the leading spirit in the Musical Society which
did much for music in Boston between 1785 and 1790.
His devotion to choral music was especially noteworthy
and he promoted some choral concerts of an artistic
quality far beyond anything yet heard in America. We
find announced for April 23, 1782, a concert under his
direction, to consist of '<em>Musica Spiritualis</em>, or Sacred
Music, being a collection of Airs, Duetts, and Choruses,
selected from the oritories [?] of Mr. Stanly, Mr. Smith
and the late celebrated Mr. Handel; together with a
favorite Dirge, set to music by Thomas Augustus Arne,
Doctor in Music. Also, a Concert on the Organ, by
Mr. Selby.' In the 'Massachusetts Gazette' of January
2, 1786, there is announced a remarkable concert to be
given by the Musical Society on January 10. Besides
prayers, psalms, and the Doxology, 'as set to musick by
Mr. Selby,' the program consisted of the overture to
Handel's 'Occasional Oratorio'; the recitative 'Comfort
ye my people,' from the 'Messiah,' and the aria, 'Every
valley shall be exalted,' from the same work; the fourth
Concerto of Amizon, <em>musica da capella</em>, op. 7; 'Let the
bright Cherubims,' from 'Samson,' and 'The trumpet
shall sound,' from the 'Messiah'; the second organ concerto
of Handel; 'a Solo, Piano, on the organ,' by Mr.
Selby; and 'a favourite overture by Mr. Bach,' performed
by 'the musical band.' A similar program was
repeated on January 16, 1787, at a 'Spiritual Concert
for the benefit of those who have known better Days.'
The 'Hallelujah Chorus' from the 'Messiah' was included
in the latter program, as was also Piccini's overture
to <em>La buona figliuola</em>, a solo from the oratorio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
'Jonah,' composed by Felsted, and a 'favourite overture'
of Carlo Ditters,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> played by 'the musical band.'</p>

<p>The Musical Society gave many concerts up to the
year 1790—mostly in subscription series and always,
it would seem, under the leadership of Selby. Apparently
there were other musical societies in Boston
as early as the year 1787, for the 'Massachusetts Centinel'
on September 22 of that year announced a 'concert
of Sacred Musick to assist in rebuilding the Meeting
House in Hollis Street, agreeably to the generous intentions
of the Musical Societies in this town.' The name
of William Billings appears twice on the program of
this concert. We have already mentioned the concert
in honor of Washington's visit to Boston at which Felsted's
oratorio, 'Jonah,' was given in its entirety—the
first time that a complete oratorio had been given in
Boston.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The last mention of Selby's name in connection with
a concert was in 1793 when the following program was
given for his benefit and that of Jacobus Pick:</p>

<div class="block1 p11">
<p>The Overture of Henry IVth<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><br>
A French Song by Mr. Mallet<br>

A French Song by Madame Douvillier<br>
A Violin Concerto, by Mr. Boullay<br>
An Italian Duetto, by Messrs. Pick and Mallet<br>
A Flute Concerto by Mr. Stone<br>
La Chasse, composed by Hoffmeister<br>
A Piano Forte Sonata, by Mr. Selby<br>
A French Trio, by Madame Douvillier, Messrs. Pick and Mallet<br>
A Duetto on the Harmonica, by Messrs. Pick &amp; Petit<br>
A Symphony, composed by Pichell</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>This program is important as marking a sharp transition
in the style of Boston concerts. Due partly to the
influx of theatrical companies, following the lifting of
the ban on dramatic productions, and partly to the
sudden increase in the number of French musicians,
concerts in Boston after the year 1790 entirely lost
their old dignified and solid demeanor and acquired
a strange new lightness, a transatlantic frivolity, a cosmopolitan
air, a flavor of complete worldliness. The
'late celebrated Mr. Handel' disappears entirely from
the concert programs of a city to which he had for long
been the musical mainstay, and in his stead enter
Pleyel, Grétry, Gluck, and 'the celebrated Haydn.'</p>

<p>Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the
leading figures in the concert life of Boston were
Messrs. Pick and Mallet, Mrs. Pownall, and Dr. Berkenhead.
The most important of these was Mallet, a
French gentleman, who is supposed to have come to
America with Lafayette and to have served in the army
of the Revolution. In addition to his concert activities
he taught music, played the organ for the 'Rev. Mr.
Kirkland's congregation,' and was one of the first music
publishers in Boston. After the year 1793 we find
his name infrequently on concert programs, and after
that year, too, we notice a decided decline in both the
number and the quality of Boston concerts.</p>

<p>That the concert-life of New England was not altogether
confined to Boston we gather from the old records
and newspaper files of Cambridge, Salem, Newport,
Providence, Newburyport, Hartford, New Haven,
and other towns. On the whole, the concerts given in
those towns followed closely the taste of Boston. As
far as we can discover, they were not very frequent;
but, when it is considered that as late as the beginning
of the nineteenth century none of the towns named
possessed as many as two thousand inhabitants and
some of them contained less than half that number, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
would be unreasonable to expect that they could have
supported serious concerts to any great extent. Indeed,
it is surprising that they should have lent their patronage
to symphonies of Haydn, Pleyel, and Stamitz; overtures,
concertos, quartets, and other numbers constituting
what in the eighteenth century were 'heavy' programs;
and we are not prepared to say how much patronage
would be forthcoming for concerts of the same
relative 'heaviness' in American towns of the same size
to-day.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Turning to New York, we find that concert life began
there about the same time as it did in Boston. In fact,
wherever the first concert in America may have been
held—a disputed point which is not of vital importance—the
impulse to give such musical entertainments
seems to have affected the whole country almost, if not
quite, simultaneously. That there were concerts held
in New York as early as 1733 appears from the publication
in the New York 'Gazette' for December 24-31 of
that year of a fearfully bad poem 'written at a Concert
of Music where there was a great Number of Ladies.'
In spite of the indiscriminate taste of the 'Gazette' it
is unfortunate that we have preserved a very few numbers
between 1725, when it first appeared, and 1733,
when Zenger's New York 'Weekly Journal' was started.
Possibly it said something in intelligible prose about
such concerts as may have been given before the latter
date. We first get on solid ground in 1736 with the
announcement for January 21 of 'a <em>Consort</em> of Musick,
Vocal and Instrumental for the Benefit of Mr. Pachelbell,
the Harpsichord Part performed by himself. The
Songs, Violins and German Flutes by private Hands.'
For nearly twenty years following there is trace of
only two concerts, concerning which no particulars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
have been vouchsafed us. Then we read in the New
York 'Mercury' of January, 1754, that Mr. Charles Love
gave 'a Concert of vocal and instrumental Musick. To
which will be added several select pieces on the hautboy
by Mr. Love. After the concert will be a <em>Ball</em>.'
In the following year William Tuckey advertised in the
'Weekly Post Boy' a 'Concert of Vocal and Instrumental
Musick' of which he was good enough to indicate
partially the program. Among other things he promised
'the celebrated dialogue between <em>Damon and
Chloe</em>, compos'd by Mr. Arne. A two part Song, in
Praise of a Soldier, by the late famous Mr. Henry Purcell.
An "Ode on Masonry"<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> never perform'd in this
country, nor ever in England but once in publick. And
a Solo on the German flute by Mr. Cobham.' Mr.
Tuckey's sympathies were pronouncedly English, but
his taste was good. A concert given in 1756 featured
a new organ built by a New Yorker named Gilfert Ash
and two songs composed by Mr. Handel, one of them
being 'in praise of musick, particularly of an organ.'
There is no further mention of concerts in the newspapers
until 1760 and, except there was a conspiracy
of silence on the part of the press, the concert life of
New York up to that year must have been extremely
meagre.</p>

<p>It would appear, however, that subscription series
started in 1760, for we find a notice in the New York
'Gazette' of January 14 that 'the Subscription Concert
will be opened on Thursday next, the 15th instant,' and
that 'those gentlemen that intend to subscribe to the
said concert, are desired to send their names to Messrs.
Dienval and Hulett who will wait on them with tickets,
for the season.' In 1762 Messrs. Leonard and Dienval
announced 'a publick and weekly Concert of Musick,'
probably a continuation of the subscription series inaugurated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
in 1762, though there is no announcement
for 1763. Apparently there were subscription concerts
every year until 1767, presumably under the same auspices.
Then there is a hiatus until 1773, when subscription
concerts were revived.</p>

<p>John Jones, in the meantime, had given summer concerts
at his Ranelagh Gardens from 1765 until the enterprise
failed in 1768. Also, Edward Bardin started a
tri-weekly concert of music at his 'King's Arms Garden
in the Broadway' in 1766. We do not know how long
he continued his musical entertainments; we only know
that he went out of business in 1769. Undeterred by the
failure of Jones and Bardin, Samuel Francis opened
Vaux Hall Gardens in 1769. He announced a concert
of music, vocal and instrumental, to be given twice a
week, but it would appear that he met with no greater
success than his predecessors.</p>

<p>Besides summer concerts at the various gardens and
the subscription concerts already alluded to, there were
between 1760 and 1775 a number of benefit concerts, as
well as a few performances by military bands and
theatrical companies. The fine program given at Mr.
Stotherd's benefit on February 9, 1770, has been quoted
in the preceding chapter. About the same year French
and Italian virtuosi began to settle in New York and
their presence soon made itself felt.</p>

<p>The only musician in New York at this period who
stands out prominently is William Tuckey and, though
he gave some benefit concerts, he was concerned mainly
with the development of church music. However, it is
worthy of note that he was the first to introduce the
'Messiah' to America, the occasion being a concert of
sacred music in 1770, devoted largely to excerpts from
that oratorio, including 'the overture and sixteen other
pieces, viz. air, recitatives and choruses.' During the
war there were a number of concerts in New York
given by officers of the British army and navy. William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Brown, who also appears in the concert life of
Philadelphia and the South, gave a subscription series
in New York in 1783 and again in 1785. Subsequently
there seems to have been a lull in the musical affairs of
the city until 1788, when subscription concerts were
revived under the direction of Alexander Reinagle,
'member of the Society of Musicians in London,' and
Henri Capron, a pupil of Gaviniés. They were continued
by Mr. and Mrs. Van Hagen, 'lately from Amsterdam.'
Pleyel, Stamitz, Dittersdorf, Martini, and
Haydn shared the chief honors on the programs of
that period, and we find a duet of Mozart on a program
offered by Reinagle and Capron in 1789.</p>

<p>Beginning about the year 1797 the concert season in
New York shifted from the winter to the summer, and
regular subscription concerts consequently declined.
Their place was taken by concerts which the enterprising
proprietors of public gardens offered as special attractions
to their patrons. It would seem at first blush
that the musical taste of the people at large was exceptionally
good when concerts of high grade really
proved attractive, but the public gardens of that period
usually did not cater to the masses. After the failure
of Samuel Francis's Vaux Hall Gardens, enterprises of
the kind seem to have lost favor. In 1793 we find Mrs.
Armory running a Vaux Hall in Great George Street
and announcing a concert of 'the most favourite overtures
and pieces from the compositions of Fisher and
Handel ... the orchestra being placed in the middle
of a large tree.' Joseph Delacroix in the following year
gave a very fine concert under the leadership of James
Hewitt at his 'Salloon,' the Ice House Garden, No. 112
Broadway. Three years later he announced concerts
of vocal and instrumental music to be given with an
orchestra of fifteen of the best musicians three times a
week at his newly decorated Vaux Hall Gardens. In
1798 he raised the number of his concerts to four a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
week, but in the following year, unfortunately, he had
to abandon the enterprise. The concerts given by Delacroix
were invariably of the highest grade, according
to later eighteenth-century standards.</p>

<p>During the summers of 1798 and 1799 there were
given nightly concerts of 'vocal and instrumental' music
at B. Ishewood's Ranelagh Garden near the Battery.
The programs were made up almost entirely of popular
songs. Joseph Corre, who opened Columbia Garden,
opposite the Battery, in 1798, and Mount Vernon Garden
on Leonard Street in 1800, hit upon the idea of attracting
both æsthete and philistine by a judicious mixture
of serious and popular programs. His serious concerts
were similar to those given by Joseph Delacroix;
his popular programs contained the same sort of stuff
as was offered at Ranelagh Gardens.</p>

<p>Besides these summer garden concerts and the winter
subscription series already mentioned there were
many single benefit concerts after the war. The first
of these, apparently, was given by William Brown in
1786, and in the same year Alexander Reinagle gave a
Gargantuan affair that included three Haydn overtures,
five excerpts from the 'Messiah' and 'Samson,' a concerto
for violin, a sonata for pianoforte, a duet for violin
and 'cello, and ten miscellaneous vocal numbers.
Between that year and the end of the century benefit
concerts were given by Henri Capron, the Van Hagens,
John Christopher Moller, Jane Hewitt, George Edward
Saliment, Mrs. Pownall, Mrs. Hodgkinson, Mme. De
Sèze, and others. As a rule these concerts followed
the prevailing fashion in the make-up of their programs.
Haydn, Pleyel, Stamitz, Sacchini, Martini,
Wranitzky, Kozeluch, and Clementi furnished the
<em>pièces de résistance</em> for programs otherwise consisting
of songs, concerts, sonatas and lesser instrumental
forms by unidentified composers. The presence of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
French operatic troupe in 1790 gave a theatrical tinge
to a few concerts in which they participated.</p>

<p>Outside of New York City there was practically no
concert life, either in New York or New Jersey. Occasionally
some musician on his way between New York
and Philadelphia or the South would give a concert in
Princeton, Newark, Trenton, or New Brunswick. One
concert in the last-named town featured 'speaking and
elegant dancing between the parts.' Albany, presumably,
had the benefit of a few concerts, perhaps by visiting
musicians from New York. Mr. Sonneck has discovered
the announcement of a creditable concert given
there in 1797 by J. H. Schmidt, 'formerly organist of
the cathedral of Schiedam in Holland,' also formerly
of Charleston and Baltimore. On the whole, however,
New York and New Jersey, except for New York City,
were musically very backward compared with New
England.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, could better illustrate the contradictory
complexity of environmental influences than
the state of musical culture in eighteenth-century Philadelphia.
Compared with the Quaker attitude toward
music, that of the Puritans was almost indecently liberal.
Yet Philadelphia was beyond doubt musically
the most cultured city in eighteenth-century America.
The cause is not apparent, but we have ample evidence
of the fact. As in the case of other American cities, it
is impossible to say when public concerts started in
Philadelphia. The first mention of concerts there, so
far discovered, is in Gottlieb Mittelberger's <em>Reise nach
Pennsylvanien im Jahre 1750</em>. But these, the author
states, were private concerts '<em>auf dem Spinnet oder
Klavicymbel</em>.' No announcements of public concerts
appear in the Philadelphia newspapers until 1757,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
when the 'Pennsylvania Gazette' announces one under
the direction of Mr. John Palma. The same gentleman
gave another concert a few months later, as we find
from the ledger of George Washington, who bought
tickets for it. No more public concerts appear before
1764 and, indeed, they seem to have been far from
common until after the war. During the last years of
the century the musical life of Philadelphia was extremely
rich, both as to public concerts and otherwise.</p>

<p>We know nothing about the concert of 1764 except
that it was under the direction of James Bremner.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Another concert under the same direction was given in
the following year. It was announced as a 'Performance
of Solemn Music,' the 'vocal parts chiefly by young
Gentlemen educated in this Seminary' (College of Philadelphia),
and accompanied by the organ. It was a
very fine concert, and the fact that it was highly successful
is eloquent of the state of musical culture in
Philadelphia at that time. Besides a chorus and airs
set to scriptural texts the program included a Stamitz
overture, the Sixth Concerto of Geminiani, an overture
by the Earl of Kelly, Martini's Second Overture, the
overture to Arne's 'Artaxerxes,' a sonata on the harpsichord,
and a solo on the violin. Two orations were
added for good measure. A series of subscription concerts
was inaugurated on Thursday, January 19, 1764,
and continued every Thursday until May 24 following.
Apparently these also were under the direction
of James Bremner and there is <em>prima facie</em> evidence
that Francis Hopkinson was connected with them in
some capacity. A second series was advertised to begin
on Thursday, November 8, 1764, and to be continued
until March 14 following. The programs of
these concerts were not printed in the newspapers, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>admission was confined to subscribers, and it seems
to have been customary to print programs for distribution
with the tickets—an eminently sane and praiseworthy
custom which fortunately still survives in
America.</p>

<p>A concert given in 1764 by Stephen Forrage for his
own benefit and that of other 'assistant performers at
the Subscription Concert,' may be mentioned, were it
only for the fact that Mr. Forrage appeared as soloist
on Benjamin Franklin's 'famous Armonica, or Musical
Glasses, so much admired for their great Sweetness and
Delicacy of its tone.' We trust he had more respect
for the musical proprieties than he evidently entertained
for the grammatical ones. After 1765 no concerts
appear until November, 1769, when Giovanni
Gualdo gave a 'Grand Concert of Vocal and Instrumental
Musick ... directed by Mr. Gualdo, after the Italian
method'—whatever that may have been. Most of
the program consisted of compositions by Mr. Gualdo,
and there were two overtures by the Earl of Kelly.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In
the same month a subscription series was started—'The
Vocal Music by Messieurs Handel, Arne, Giardini, Jackson,
Stanley, and others. The instrumental Music by
Messieurs Geminiani, Barbella, Campioni, Zanetti, Pellegrino,
Abel, Bach, Gualdo, the Earl of Kelly and
others.' Gualdo gave two benefit concerts in 1770 and
one in 1771. He died soon after. In the latter year
also Mr. John McLean, instructor on the German flute,
gave a concert 'performed by a full Band of Music,
with Trumpets, Kettle Drum, and every instrument
that can be introduced with Propriety,' and 'interspersed
with the most pleasing and select Pieces, composed
by approved authors.' A concert of popular
songs by a Mr. Smith in 1772 was apparently the only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>public attempt to break the musical monotony of Philadelphia
until Signior Sodi, 'first dancing master of
the opera in Paris and London,' gave a grand affair at
which a Mr. Vidal, 'musician of the Chambers of the
King of Portugal,' played 'on divers instruments of music,'
while Signior Sodi, Miss Sodi, and Mr. Hullett (of
New York) danced minuets, a louvre, a 'new Philadelphia
cotillion,' a rigadoon, an allemande, a jigg, and a
hompipe. In the same year 'Mr. Victor, musician to
her late Royal Highness the Princess of Wales and
Organist of St. George's, London,' advertised a performance
on 'his new musical instruments ... the one he
calls <em>tromba doppio con tympana</em>, on which he plays
the first and second trumpet and a pair of annexed
kettle drums with the feet, all at once; the other is
called <em>cymbaline d'amour</em>, which resembles the musical
glasses played by harpsichord keys, never subject to
come out of tune, both of his own invention.'</p>

<p>From all of which appears that for a short time before
the war musical life in Philadelphia degenerated
sadly. Presumably the people were too much interested
in the big and burning issues of the day to lend
substantial support to concert givers. Likewise during
the war they were too much occupied with more vital
and disturbing affairs. While Lord Howe's army occupied
Philadelphia there were, according to Capt.
Johann Heinrich of the Hessian Jäger Corps, 'assemblies,
concerts, comedies, clubs, and the like,' but it
would hardly be patriotic to consider these activities
of the enemy. Apart from them there were no public
performances during the war until, on December 11,
1781, Lucerne, the French minister, gave an 'elegant
concert' in honor of Generals Washington and Greene
'and a very polite circle of gentlemen and ladies,' at
which was performed Francis Hopkinson's patriotic
'oratorial entertainment "Temple of Minerva".'</p>

<p>After the war, however, the musical life of Philadelphia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
awoke with a bound. The revival was inaugurated
by a fortnightly series of city concerts in 1783
under the leadership of John Bentley. A second series
under the same leadership followed in 1784. Bentley
promised for his second season 'a more elegant and
perfect entertainment than it was possible (from the
peculiar circumstances of the time) to procure during
the last winter,' and he felt encouraged in his enterprise
by 'the rising taste for music, and its improved
state in Philadelphia.' Bentley discontinued his concerts
in 1785-86 and apparently that season was barren
of such entertainments. In 1786, however, there came
the advent of Alexander Reinagle. Together with
Henri Capron, William Brown, and Alexander Juhan
he started in that year a series of twelve fortnightly
concerts, the programs of which were all announced
in the newspapers. Certainly there could have been
no lack of musical culture among the Philadelphians
when they supported an extended series of such concerts
as were given by Reinagle <em>et al.</em> The concerts
were continued in the winter of 1787-88 and then apparently
discontinued until 1792, when they were revived
by Messrs. Reinagle and Capron in conjunction
with John Christopher Moller. In these the high standard
of the preceding concerts was well maintained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a Mr. Duplessis, who kept an English
school for young gentlemen, started a series of fourteen
concerts on his own account in 1786, but we do
not know how many he succeeded in giving. In the
same year an amateur subscription series was started,
apparently under the auspices of a society called the
'Musical Club,' and was continued every season until
1790-91. Then, it seems, there was a consolidation of
amateurs and professionals in 1794, with Reinagle as
the guiding spirit. They gave a season of six subscription
concerts with programs devoted largely to Haydn,
Pleyel, and Handel. No further subscription series are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
discoverable before the end of the century, with the exception
of those given by Mrs. Grattan, who, in 1797,
announced eight subscription concerts. As she referred
to these as 'the second Ladies Concert' the inference is
that she had already given a series in 1796. Mrs. Grattan
confined her activities chiefly to chamber and vocal
music, but as we find Handel, Haydn, Pleyel, Paesiello,
Viotti, and Sacchini figuring on her programs, it is evident
that the public taste had not degenerated. She
gave another season in 1797-98, after which she left
Philadelphia for Charleston, appearing later in New
York. In addition to regular subscription concerts there
were, after the Revolution, an increasing number of
affairs given for private profit, for charity, and for
other purposes. Especially noteworthy are the activities
of Andrew Adgate, who was a real pioneer of artistic
choral music in Philadelphia. In 1784 Adgate
founded by subscription 'The Institution for the Encouragement
of Church Music,' which became known in
1785 as the Uranian Society and in 1787 as the Uranian
Academy of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we mentioned the Grand
Concert given on May 4, 1786, with a chorus of 230 and
an orchestra of 50, as well as the concert of April 12,
1787. Both were given under the auspices of the Uranian
Society, with Adgate as conductor. It is worthy of
note that the syllabus of the second concert was accompanied
by remarks on the pieces to be performed—probably
the first example of annotated programs in
America. The Uranian Academy was actually opened
in 1787 and its second annual concert was held in 1788.
How long afterward it survived we cannot say, as no
further references to it are found in the newspapers.
According to Scharf and Westcott's 'History of Philadelphia,'
however, it was active until after 1800.</p>

<p>After 1788 the sacred choral concerts—or 'oratorios,'
as they were called—gradually approximated the style<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of the purely secular vocal and instrumental concerts,
and after 1790 they seem to have disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>The arrival in 1790 of the French company of which
we have already spoken introduced a strikingly novel
note into the concert life of Philadelphia. In contrast
to the style of thing done by Bremner, Hopkinson,
Reinagle, and other men of severe taste their programs
do not strike us too favorably. Indeed, their concerts
marked the beginning of a curious corruption in the
public taste and of a tendency toward indiscriminate
program-making which has not yet completely disappeared
from our midst. From this time until the end
of the century hardly a program appears that does not
contain a theatrical composition of Monsigny, Paesiello,
Sacchini, Cimarosa, Cherubini, or some other operatic
writer of this period, and, as we draw nearer to the
nineteenth century, the more miscellaneous become the
programs. During those years the concert-life of
Philadelphia was dominated largely by French musicians,
most of whom, it would appear, were men who
had received the best European training. We notice,
for instance, that Joseph César was 'a pupil of the celebrated
Signor Viotti and first violin of the theatre in
Cape François,' and that Victor Pelissier was 'first
French horn in the theatre in Cape François.' Perhaps
the fact that so many of the French musicians were
virtuosi inspired the making of programs devoted to
medleys, ariettes, 'favourite sonatas,' and concertos for
every instrument that could possibly be employed solo.
Yet even such a thorough artist as Alexander Reinagle
descended—perforce, we presume—to the inclusion in
his programs of such vocal gems as 'Kiss me now or
never,' 'Poor Tom Bowling,' 'My Poll and my partner
Joe,' 'A Smile from the girl of my heart,' and so forth.
Mr. and Mrs. Hodgkinson, Mrs. Pownall, Miss Broadhurst
and others gave concerts with programs equally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
miscellaneous, and it must be admitted that all this
points to a distinct musical retrogression in Philadelphia
during the last decade of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There remain to be mentioned the summer concerts
given in public gardens which became very popular
toward the beginning of the nineteenth century. They
were inaugurated, it would seem, by a Mr. Vincent M.
Pelosi, proprietor of the Pennsylvania Coffee House,
who proposed for the summer season of 1786 'to open
a Concert of Harmonial Music,' to be continued weekly
from the first Thursday of June to the last Thursday
of September. His example was followed in 1789 by
Messrs. George and Robert Gray, proprietors of 'Gray's
Gardens,' who gave weekly concerts from May to October,
and continued that feature until about 1793. As
their programs included compositions of Haydn, Stamitz,
Martini, and Abel, it may be seen that they adhered
to the prevailing standard. George Esterley started
concerts at his 'Vauxhall Harrowgate' in 1789, engaging
as soloist 'a lady from Europe who has performed in
all the operas in the theatres Royal of Dublin and Edinburgh.'
The announcement has a very modern ring.
As far as we know Esterley continued his enterprise
at least until 1796, presenting somewhat the same programs
as Messrs. Gray. In 1797 Messrs. Bates and Darley
opened Bush Hill or Pennsylvania Tea Gardens
with vocal and instrumental music as a feature, but
were obliged to dissolve partnership in the same year.
John Mearns, proprietor of the Centre House Tavern
and Gardens, announced in 1799 that he would add
'to the entertainment his house afforded ... at a very
great expense ... a grand organ of the first power
and tone, which [would] be played every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday evening during the summer.'
He added regular concerts in the following summer.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It is not a far-fetched surmise that concerts, in the
broadest acceptation of the term, were known in the
South earlier than in any other part of the country.
The colonial cavalier, who, after the fashion of English
gentlemen at the time, kept a chest of viols in his
house, must occasionally have found among his visitors
a sufficient number of competent players to form an
ensemble of some sort. As the population increased
and the opportunities for social intercourse improved
these occasions undoubtedly became frequent, and,
without any sacrifice of historical probability, one can
easily imagine social gatherings at which the most skillful
musicians performed concerted pieces for the entertainment
of the other guests. The picture is quite
in accord with what we know of English and Southern
colonial society in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
century. Certainly, in Charleston and other centres
of Southern society and culture, it is hard to imagine
that private musical affairs were not quite common
at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Indeed,
a large proportion of the earlier public concerts
in Charleston were given by amateurs with the assistance
of professional musicians, and it is reasonable to
assume that a habit of giving private concerts preceded
the custom of giving public ones.</p>

<p>The first public concert we find trace of in Charleston
was a benefit given for Mr. John Salter in 1732.
Several other benefit concerts were given in the same
year. We know nothing about them except that they
consisted of vocal and instrumental music and were
usually followed by a ball. Mr. Sonneck thinks it probable
that they were devoted to 'more or less skillful
renditions of Corelli, Vivaldi, Purcell, Abaco, Handel,
Geminiani, and such other masters whose fame was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
firmly established in Europe.' Probably subscription
concerts started in 1732 or 1733, for in the latter year
we find 'N. B.'s' to concert advertisements to the effect
that 'This will be the last Concert' and 'This is the first
time on the subscription.' These subscription seasons
apparently continued until 1735. From that year until
1751 there are no concerts advertised except a benefit
for John Salter and one for Charles Theodore Pachelbel.
A benefit concert in 1751, one in 1755, and one in
1760 brings us through years of famine to 1765 and
Mr. Thomas Pike. Mr. Pike was a talented person who
played the French horn and the bassoon, and also
taught ladies and gentlemen 'very expeditiously on
moderate terms in <em>Orchesography</em> (or the art of dancing
by characters and demonstrative figures)'. He gave
a concert in 1765 with the assistance of 'gentlemen of the
place,' and was obliging enough to publish the program,
which was devoted to horn, violoncello, harpsichord,
and bassoon concertos, a song, a trio, and the overture
of Handel's 'Scipio.'</p>

<p>In 1767 Messrs. Bohrer, Morgan and Comp started
weekly concerts at their Charleston Vauxhall. They
did not include tea and coffee in the price of the tickets,
but on one extraordinary occasion when 'four or five
pieces' were exhibited between the parts of the concert
'by a person who is confident very few in town ever
saw, or can equal, his performance,'—on that extraordinary
occasion tea and coffee were included in the expense
'till the person above mentioned begins.' Unfortunately
we do not know the nature of the person's
performance. He was, it seems, a very exclusive person
and refused to appear more than once in Charleston,
'unless by the particular desire of a genteel company.'
Nevertheless the enterprise of Messrs. Bohrer,
Morgan and Comp does not seem to have succeeded.
Peter Valton gave a benefit concert in 1768 and a subscription
concert in 1769. In the meantime the St. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>Cæcilia
Society, which was founded in 1762, had been giving
regular subscription seasons since 1766 or perhaps
earlier. That these St. Cæcilia Concerts were important
affairs is evident from an advertisement inserted
by the society in the New York, Philadelphia, and Boston
papers in 1771, calling for a first and second violin,
two hautboys, and a bassoon, and offering to such, if
'properly qualified,' a one-, two-, or three-year contract.
The society continued to give regular concerts all during
the century, but we have no information as to their
nature.</p>

<p>Outside the St. Cæcilia concerts we find in 1772 only
one, 'the vocal part by a gentleman, who does it merely
to oblige on this occasion,' and, in 1773, two at which
a Mr. Saunders exhibited 'his highest <em>dexterity</em> and
<em>grand deception</em>.' In 1774 a Mr. Francheschini, who
seems to have been a violinist of the St. Cæcilia Society,
announced a concert for his benefit by express
permission of that organization. Mr. Van Hagen, of
Rotterdam, who afterward appeared in New York and
Boston, gave a concert in the same year, at which
Signora Castella performed on the musical glasses.
Then the war intervened, putting practically a complete
quietus on music for the time being.</p>

<p>So far, the concert-life of Charleston, from what we
know of it, does not at all compare with that of contemporary
New York, Philadelphia, or Boston. After
the war it improved somewhat, but the intrusion of
theatrical people into the concert field immediately
following the war was very unfortunate from a musical
point of view. With the exception of a subscription
series started in 1786 by Joseph Lafar, and concerning
which we have no particulars, there do not appear to
have been any concerts worthy of the name until after
1790. They were simply scrappy theatrical entertainments,
disguised sufficiently to evade the law which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
seems to have existed in restraint of such. The following
advertisement shows the <em>modus operandi</em>, which is
very suggestive of the 'Sacred Concerts' given on Sundays
in many of our present-day vaudeville houses.
'On Saturday evening at the Lecture Room, late Harmony
Hall, will be a Concert, between the parts will
be rehearsed (gratis) the musical piece of <em>Thomas and
Sally</em>. To which will be added, a pantomime, called
<em>Columbia</em>, or <em>Harlequin Shipwreck'd</em>.'</p>

<p>Even acrobatic performances were introduced into
the concerts of this period. Several concerts for charity
were given in 1791, and may have been real concerts,
though we have no particulars concerning them.
George Washington attended one in that year, at which,
he says, 'there were at least 400 ladies the number and
appearance of which exceeded anything of the kind I
had ever seen.' Excusably enough, perhaps, he was not
sufficiently interested in the music to say anything
about it.</p>

<p>From 1793 on, however, the concert-life of Charleston
was very rich. Resides the subscription concerts
of the St. Cecilia<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Society, there were regular series
by the Harmonic Society, which appeared in 1794, as
well as frequent concerts given by individual musicians.
Much of this activity was due to the influx of
French musicians following the revolutions in France
and St. Domingo. We find most of the benefit concerts
from 1793 to the end of the century given by people
with French names, and there is a decided leaning
toward French composers, such as Grétry, Gossec, Davaux,
Michel, La Motte, Guenin, and Gluck. However,
the concerts on the whole were sufficiently eclectic,
featuring also the compositions of Haydn, Pleyel, Stamitz,
Gyrowetz, Corelli, Giornovichi, Hoffmeister, Viotti,
Martini, dementi, Sacchini, Jarnovick, Krumpholtz.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>Handel, Cimarosa, and even Mozart.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Certainly the
music lovers of Charleston did not suffer from lack
of variety.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pownall, whom we have already met, gave a concert
in 1796 which was somewhat out of the ordinary.
It was advertised as a <em>Grand Concert Spiritualé</em>[!],
and was devoted almost exclusively to 'overtures, songs
and duets, selected from the most celebrated of Handel's
oratorios: the "Messiah," "Judas Maccabæus," "Esther,"
etc., etc.' In the same year there was advertised a
'Grand Musical Festival,' which is interesting for many
reasons. Probably it was the first musical affair in
America to which the term 'Festival' was applied; it
employed an orchestra of over thirty performers, which
was an unusually large ensemble for that time, and it
included among the numbers on its program the overture
to Gluck's <em>Iphigénie en Aulide</em> and Haydn's <em>Stabat
Mater</em>—'the celebrated <em>Stabat Mater</em> of Doctor Haydn,'
as the announcement puts it. Apart from these, there
were no further concerts in the last decade of the century
which call for special mention. Two attempts were
made to revive the Vaux Hall, one by 'Citizen' Cornet
in 1795 and one by Mons. Placide in 1799, but they do
not seem to have added much of value to the musical
life of the city. On the whole, in Charleston, as elsewhere
in America, the beginning of the nineteenth century
saw a perceptible decline in the public demand
for music of the best kind.</p>

<p>Our information on early concert-life in other Southern
cities does not enable us to say much about it. In
Maryland, Annapolis probably took the lead musically
until after the middle of the century, but no sources
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>have been disclosed which would supply us with any
details of its musical life. We are a little better informed
on musical affairs in Baltimore subsequent to
the year 1780 and it would seem that toward the end
of the century that city resembled Charleston very
closely in the number and quality of its concerts. Also
to Baltimore as to Charleston there was a large influx
of French musicians after 1790, and with similar results.
We know nothing about concerts in Baltimore
prior to the year 1784, when William Brown demonstrated
his 'superior talents on the German flute.' A
couple of concerts, one of instrumental music only, are
advertised for 1786, and in the same year we find the
first notice of a subscription season. As far as we can
discover subscription concerts were a regular feature
of the musical life of the city until the end of the
century. In 1790 Ishmail Spicer, who conducted a singing
school for the improvement of church music, exhibited
his pupils in a concert of sacred music. Then
came the French musicians with their overtures of
Grétry and their ariettes of Dalayrac. Like their compatriots
in Charleston, they proved commendably catholic
in their tastes, and, in addition to French compositions,
gave frequent examples of Haydn, Pleyel, Stamitz,
Bach, and Gyrowetz (whose name they never succeeded
in spelling correctly). Though they practically
monopolized musical affairs in Baltimore for many
years, they collaborated freely with English, German,
and Italian musicians, all of which made for the musical
good of the city. It may be mentioned that Alexander
Reinagle gave some concerts in Baltimore in 1791
and 1792, with programs of a quality which might be
expected from an artist of his superior attainments,
and he seems to have been the only non-French musician
who counted much in the concert life of Baltimore
in the last decade of the century. As elsewhere in
America, there were open-air concerts in summer at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
such resorts of the Baltimore fashionables as Gray's
Gardens and Chatsworth Gardens, and, as elsewhere in
America, the musical life of the people degenerated
sadly with the opening of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Petersburg, Norfolk,
Richmond, Alexandria, Savannah and other Southern
cities apparently had a musical life as rich as could
reasonably be expected in communities of their size.
We possess little information concerning them, but there
have been unearthed by Mr. Sonneck a number of references
to concerts in these cities, sometimes with programs
quoted in full, which show that they heard the
best contemporary music occasionally, and perhaps
even frequently. Many of the concerts were given by
visiting musicians, such as Mrs. Pick, Mrs. Sully, Mrs.
D. Hemard, Mr. Graupner, Mr. Shaw, and others whose
names appear on the concert programs of Charleston,
Philadelphia, and Roston. Rut it is certain that there
was also in most of these cities a musical life which
functioned quite independently of such visitors. Fredericksburg,
we know, had a Harmonic Society in 1784,
which gave concerts 'the third Wednesday evening in
each month,' and it is not improbable that similar societies
existed in other towns where there was much
social intercourse between people of culture, refinement
and exceeding leisure. Among the music-loving,
pleasure-loving, gregarious gentlefolk of the old South,
unhampered by the fetters of occupation and confronted
merely with the task of making life pass as
pleasantly as possible, the formation of such societies
must have been inevitable. Perhaps among the families
of their descendants scattered all over the country
there may be preserved many old documents that would
throw a welcome light on their musical life, but until
such documents do appear we must rest content with
the surmise, based upon the little information we possess,
that musical culture in the South, if it did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
quite reach the standard attained in Boston, New York,
and Philadelphia, was at least more widely diffused
than elsewhere in America.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A comparison between the eighteenth-century concert
life of America and of Europe will easily show
that this country, even considering its many disadvantages,
was not very far behind the older continent.
Paris, London, Vienna, Berlin, and perhaps a few other
German cities like Mannheim and Hamburg, were
ahead of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston
in the quality of their concerts, but not so very far
ahead as to make the American cities look provincial in
comparison. When we consider the wealth of tradition
behind the musical life of Europe and the many difficulties
which confronted early concert givers in America
the difference appears still less. But, as we pointed
out in the last chapter, there was one very profound
and important difference—the European cities were
productive, the American cities were not. And, after
all, the artistic stature of a country must finally be
measured not by what it appreciates, but by what it
creates. Thus measured, America of the eighteenth
century was still a musical infant.</p>

<p>All over the country in the last decade of the eighteenth
century there is noticeable a decline in the musical
taste of the American people as represented in
their public musical life. This was due probably to a
variety of causes, chief among which seems to have
been the influx, after the Revolution, of a flood of immigrants
lacking the culture which the colonists had
inherited or through long-settled and prosperous residence
acquired. The second decade of the nineteenth
century, however, saw a renaissance of musical activity,
which was developed into vigorous life chiefly through
the agency of definitely constituted musical organizations.
The concerts of the eighteenth century, on the
whole, were rendered possible by a coöperation between
people of culture, which in itself constituted a
loose sort of organization. This coöperation, indeed,
crystallized about the middle of the century into a
number of avowedly musical societies. The history of
the earliest of these is wrapped in considerable obscurity
and there is an impressive number of them
claiming to be called the first. The claim can never
satisfactorily be determined, for it is quite impossible
to define categorically the limits of a musical organization.
Broadly, the term covers any number of people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
coöperating for a musical purpose, and would include
a singing class of half a dozen members as fittingly
as a modern orchestra or a musical society of hundreds.</p>

<p>We may, however, define a musical society in the
modern sense as a body of people regularly and permanently
organized for the carrying out of a definite
program of musical education, study or performance.
Such societies in America have been an evolution.
They have evolved, on the one hand, from coöperation
between cultured amateurs for the purpose of giving
musical performances and, on the other, from the
formation of singing classes for cultivating a proper
skill in rendering the psalms. There is, consequently,
considerable justification for the course taken by some
historians in looking upon these singing classes as the
first of our musical organizations, though, as will appear
later, they had nothing to do with the formation
of our earliest musical societies properly so called,
such as the St. Cecilia Society of Charleston, the Musical
Society of Boston or the Harmonic Society of
New York.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>As far as we know, the first avowedly musical organization
in America was the Orpheus Club, which
is said to have existed in Philadelphia in 1759. We
possess no information concerning it. Philadelphia at
that time contained a goodly number of music lovers.
Such men as John Penn, James Brenner, Dr. Kuhn,
and Francis Hopkinson, were then engaged in breathing
the spirit of life into the dead body of musical
Philadelphia. How well they succeeded we have seen
in our chapter on early concerts. Musical gatherings
were frequent at their homes and it is not impossible
that they were prominently concerned in the formation
of the Orpheus Club. If they were, the activities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
that organization must have been very interesting and
we can only regret that no record of them has seen
the light.</p>

<p>In default of unimpeachable evidence even of the
existence of the Orpheus Club at the time mentioned
we must award the title of pioneer among American
musical organizations to the St. Cecilia Society of
Charleston.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This society was founded in 1762. According
to the rules, which were 'agreed upon and
finally confirmed' in 1773, it consisted of one hundred
and twenty members and its main purpose apparently
was to give concerts. Until well into the nineteenth
century it was the centre of the concert life of Charleston
and for many years it seemed indeed to have almost
a monopoly of the musical talent, amateur and
professional, in the city. It even went as far as Boston
to gather properly qualified performers into its
fold. In addition to a yearly concert on St. Cecilia's
Day, the society gave regular fortnightly concerts during
the season. The orchestra was composed of gentlemen
performers and professional musicians—the
latter engaged by the year. It was the nearest approach
to a permanent orchestra that existed in America
outside the theatres before the nineteenth century
and there is every likelihood that its performances
reached a high standard of technical and artistic excellence.</p>

<p>An Orpheus Society apparently existed in Charleston
in 1772 and there has been found an allusion to an
Amateur Society in 1791. A Harmonic Society also
appeared there in 1794. All these societies gave concerts,
but there are so few references to them in the
contemporary press that we know nothing else definite
about them. Probably their activities were to a large
extent private and their concerts were confined to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>members. This would easily account for the absence
of their names from the newspaper advertisement.
There was a musical society in Baltimore in 1799 and a
Harmonic Society in Fredericksburg, Va., in 1784. We
know nothing about the former, but the latter, we
gather, was 'peculiarly intended for benevolent purposes'
and gave concerts on the third Wednesday evening
of each month. Whether musical societies also
existed in other Southern towns, such as Williamsburg,
Richmond, Alexandria, Norfolk, and Petersburg, it is
impossible to say. Probably they did. All the chief
Virginia towns were of about equal size and importance,
and social conditions in all of them were strikingly
alike. The existence of a musical society in one
of them is <em>prima facie</em> evidence of its existence in the
others.</p>

<p>Considering the great activity apparent in the musical
life of Philadelphia during the second half of the
eighteenth century, the dearth of musical organizations
is surprising. There appears to have been a
musical club under the auspices of which subscription
concerts, known collectively as the 'Amateur Concert,'
were given between 1787 and 1789. This and
the Orpheus Club already mentioned were the only
musical societies existing in Philadelphia during the
eighteenth century as far as we can discover. The
Uranian Society is hard to classify, but it was really
more an educational institution than a musical society
in the accepted meaning of the term. It was founded
in 1784 by Andrew Adgate, as an 'Institution for the
Encouragement of Church Music,' an 'Institution for
promoting the knowledge of psalmody' and an 'Institution
for diffusing more generally the knowledge of
Vocal Music.' Evidently there was some confusion in
Mr. Adgate's mind as to the exact purpose of his institution.
It was a somewhat Utopian scheme, contemplating
the establishment of a free school for the study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
of vocal music, open to all denominations and subsisting
on public bounty. The institution became known
as the Uranian Society in 1785 and as the Uranian
Academy in 1787. The plan of the academy, as finally
formulated in the latter year, shows that its purpose
had definitely narrowed down to the teaching of church
music. The country was not yet ripe for such an undertaking
and the enterprise failed, but between 1785
and 1787 it was responsible for a number of choral
concerts on a scale hitherto unequalled in America.</p>

<p>Considering that there was an active concert life in
New York at least as early as 1754, it might be presumed
that musical societies of some sort existed there
at that date, but we have no evidence on the subject.
The first mention we find of a musical society in New
York is contained in the advertisement of a concert
in 1773 at which some of the instrumental parts were
played by gentlemen of the Harmonic Society. Possibly
the Harmonic Society had already been in existence
for some years, but up to 1773 it escaped mention
in the newspapers. How long it lasted we cannot
say. In 1786 we find in the New York 'Daily Advertiser'
an announcement that 'the Society for promoting
vocal music meet at six o'clock this evening at Mr.
Halett's School Room in Little Queen Street, agreeable
to adjournment.' No further mention of the society
appears and there is no clew to its name or to the
length of its existence. Obviously it was not identical
with the Harmonic, for the gentlemen of that society
seem to have been devoted chiefly to instrumental
music.</p>

<p>There was in New York a St. Cecilia Society, founded
apparently in 1791, 'with a view to cultivate the science
of music and good taste in its education' (?). Instrumental
music was its main consideration and it held
weekly concerts, the nature of which we have been
unable to discover. We know only that 'the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
professors of music' were 'members and performers
at these concerts.' The society lasted until 1799, when
it was amalgamated with the Harmonical Society,
which had been founded in 1796 'for the purpose of
cultivating the knowledge of vocal and instrumental
music.' The result of the amalgamation was the Philharmonic
Society which held its first annual concert
at the Tontine Hotel on Broadway in December, 1800,
'with a variety of vocal and instrumental music by
the most celebrated performers in the city.' It is impossible
to say how long the Philharmonic lasted, but
probably it survived until well into the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>In 1793 there appears a mention of a Uranian Musical
Society, which 'was instituted for improvement in
sacred vocal music.' Meetings were held every Wednesday,
and, judging from the number of prominent
New Yorkers included in its membership, the society
must have exercised considerable influence. The last
mention of it appears in 1798, but there is no evidence
that it ceased to exist in that year. Of the Polyhymnia
Society, founded in 1799, and the Euterpean Society,
which probably first appeared in 1800, we know nothing.
According to Ritter, the latter was considered as
'perhaps the oldest musical society in the United
States,' and 'as the lineal descendant of the old Apollo.'
There is absolutely no evidence to support either of
these statements. Mr. Sonneck quotes from the
'Sketches and Impressions' of Thomas Goodwin, published
in 1887, the following note on the subject: 'The
Euterpean, an amateur orchestra, was already an old
organization half a century ago. It had been well
managed, and owned a small library and several valuable
instruments.... I have a program of its forty-eighth
anniversary concert, given January 21, 1847,
which would carry its organization back to the last
century.' From the fact that the Euterpean Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
does not appear among the musical societies in the
directory of 1799, Mr. Sonneck is inclined to the opinion
that the society was founded on January 21, 1800.</p>

<p>Probably in New York and elsewhere in America
there were a number of convivial clubs in which music,
especially the singing of glees and catches, occupied
an important place. The frequency of such organizations
in England is an argument in favor of the assumption,
for English life was reproduced very much
in detail by the American colonists. It is not surprising
that they escaped mention in the contemporary
press, as their activities were not of any public interest.
An exception must be made in favor of the Columbian
Anacreontic Society, which was modelled upon
the famous Anacreontic Society of London. The latter
is of special interest to Americans, since it furnished
indirectly the music of 'The Star Spangled Banner.'
The New York version of the society probably was
more innocuous than its English model, though its affairs
must have been marked by a robust jolity. It
was founded by John Hodgkinson, a former member of
the London Anacreontic Society, whose excellent musical
endowments and achievements did not prevent him
from being a faithful worshipper of Bacchus, and
possibly it numbered also in its membership other
graduates of its English prototype. The exact date of
its foundation is not known, but it certainly existed in
1795, as we glean from the following item in a concert
program of that year:</p>

<p>'<em>Collini's Odes on the Passions</em> (!), to be spoken by
Mr. Hodgkinson. With music representative of each
passion; as performed at the <em>Anacreontic Society</em>, composed
by J. Hewitt.' This, Mr. Sonneck notes, 'is in
all probability the earliest example of melodramatic
music composed in America.' Unfortunately we have
no other data on the nature of the music performed
at the concerts of the society. These were held usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
at the Tontine Coffee House, and it may be assumed
that they were devoted chiefly to catches, glees, and
other songs similar to those performed by the English
society, but perhaps not so intimately frank. Unlike the
English society, but curiously like every American stag
society, before or since, the Columbian Anacreontic
held an annual ladies' night. The custom carries an
unpleasantly philistine flavor, which is further emphasized
when we read an announcement that such members
of the society as chose to attend a benefit performance
for John Hodgkinson would be accommodated
in the 'Shakespeare Box' and would 'wear their
badges.' But in spite of all this it seems to have been
of some value in the musical life of New York.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>During the first half of the nineteenth century the
chief musical societies in New York seem to have been
the New York Choral Society, the Philharmonic Society,
the Euterpean Society, the Handel and Haydn
Society, The Musical Fund, and the Sacred Music Society.
Of the Euterpean Society we have already
spoken as having been founded probably in 1800. Apparently
it was composed chiefly of wealthy amateurs
and was somewhat dilettante in its activities. A contemporary
critic thus arraigns it: 'This society, from
its long standing, the respectability of its officers, and
the individual talent of its members, might possess the
most extensive influence in the musical community. It
has in its possession funds, and the largest library of
instrumental music in the country; and yet, with all
these advantages on its side, what has the Euterpean
done, or what does it do? It can be summed up in a
few words. A few of its members meet every Friday
evening and play overtures and symphonies; and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
year they give an indifferent concert and a ball, the
last of which is the chief attraction. Now, we ask the
Euterpean if, like a horse in a mill, they are forever
to pursue this eternal round?'</p>

<p>The Euterpean did not continue that or any other
course for very long, but, whatever justice there may
have been in the foregoing criticisms, it was certainly
the only instrumental music society in New York during
the years immediately preceding the advent of the
Philharmonic. Possibly its annual concert was 'indifferent,'
but the program of 1839, quoted by Dr. Ritter,
which includes compositions of Herold, Auber, Bellini,
Boehm, Purcell, Rossini, and Thalberg, would argue
the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The orchestra was of sufficiently good
symphonic proportions. It consisted of six first violins,
five second violins, four tenors, three 'celli, two
contrabasses, four flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two
bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones,
kettle drums, drum and cymbals. Apparently the
principals in the orchestra of the Euterpean lacked zeal
and enterprise, but, whatever their faults, we are justified
in looking upon the society as the parent of the
Philharmonic and as an important factor in the development
of orchestral music in New York.</p>

<p>Of this Philharmonic Society, which succeeded the
Euterpean and which is still flourishing, we shall speak
in a later chapter. As far as we can discover it had
nothing to do with the earlier society of the same name
which was founded in 1799 of the junction between
the Harmonical and the St. Cecilia societies. The earlier
Philharmonic is somewhat elusive. If the occasional
allusions to a Philharmonic Society during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>first decades of the nineteenth century referred to the
same organization, it probably existed until about 1829.
There is a possibility, however, that the original Philharmonic
failed and that various attempts were made
to form other societies under the same name. Dr. Ritter
says that the Musical Fund, organized about 1828,
was the successor to a Philharmonic, the object of
which was 'to promote the cultivation of the science of
music; to afford facilities for the exhibition of talent,
and its advancement to fair competition among the profession
and amateurs.' As the Musical Fund gave
monthly rehearsals for 'the display of glee and solo
talent,' it may be inferred that the Philharmonic was
concerned mainly if not altogether with vocal music;
but we have been unable to discover any evidence
which would show that the two societies had anything
in common.</p>

<p>The New York Choral Society, which devoted its energies
to sacred music, seems to have done very notable
work during the short time it lasted. It was
founded in 1823, chiefly by Episcopal clergymen, and
its first grand concert, given at St. George's Church on
Beekman Street in 1824, is interesting enough to deserve
citation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately contemporary critics were more enthusiastic
than discriminating and it is impossible to
tell what sort of performance was given of this excellent
program. The effect of the forte parts of Mozart's
<em>motetto</em>, one critic asserts, 'was almost overwhelming
to a great number of the auditors, and will not be soon
forgotten.' The same gentleman quite loses his balance
over the 'sublime and majestic chorus from the
oratorio of "Mount of Olives," which was another of
the full pieces that had never before been presented
to the musical public of this city. The connoisseurs
and critics were watching with considerable solicitude
to hear the splendid effort of genius, and which may
be justly ranked among the first compositions of the
present day. We believe we may assert with confidence
that the expectations of all were fully realized,
and, with regard to many of the audience, far exceeded.
The effect was indeed grand, and was heightened
by the trumpet of Mr. Petrie, and the kettle
drums.'</p>

<p>In connection with Mr. Petrie's trumpet it may be of
interest to note the extraordinary predilection of New
Yorkers at that time for brass instruments. Dr. Ritter
quotes the following from a contemporary critic: 'The
uncommon partiality our citizens manifest for the
noisy part of the orchestra has been lately much commented
upon by strangers. The trumpet and trombone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
occupy, in our concerts, the <em>posts of honor</em>. True
it is, Mr. Norton and Mr. Gambeti are excellent performers—but
we hear them in concerts too often. In
England they have Harper, a first-rate trumpet; and
Germany has Schmidt, the best trombone that ever
existed. This gentleman visited England and was
heard occasionally, but at Niblo's Garden we will undertake
to say that more trumpet and trombone concertos
were played last season than have been heard
in England and Germany for two years. If Mr. Young
adds himself to this triumvirate next season, we may
fairly expect New York <em>will be blown away</em>.'</p>

<p>The Choral Society seems to have been eclipsed and
perhaps absorbed by the New York Sacred Music Society,
which was founded in the same year. The latter
owed its existence to the somewhat peculiar circumstance
of a strike among church choristers. Considerable
reputation attached to the choir of Zion
Church, which was known as the Zion Church Musical
Association. The association applied to the vestry
for an increase of salary or permission to give a concert.
Their request was refused, and, after some bickering,
the choir resigned and formed The New York
Sacred Music Society. The history of this society is
one of brilliant accomplishment. At first its means
and its membership were limited, and its artistic ambitions
were hampered by the lackadaisical attitude of
most of its members, to whom the meeting room of the
society was merely 'a pleasant place in which to pass
an evening, to see their friends, and hear a little
music.' Nevertheless, a few years after its foundation
it was already doing work of a standard that must
give it a notable place in the history of New York musical
organizations. In 1827 it gave a concert for the
benefit of the Greek patriots, with a program on which
figured the names of Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, Arne,
and Jomelli. There was an orchestra of twenty-seven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
a chorus of about sixty, and a number of distinguished
soloists, which included the famous Madame Malibran.
'From this period,' says the New York 'Musical Journal,'
'the history of the progress of the highest species
of sacred music in this city is identified with the history
of the society.'</p>

<p>Four years later the Sacred Music Society produced
the 'Messiah' in its entirety, under the leadership of
Uriah C. Hill, whom we shall have occasion to meet
later. There was an orchestra of thirty-eight instruments
and a chorus of seventy-four voices. Encouraged
by its success it gave Haydn's 'Te Deum' and 'Creation,'
and in 1838 it produced Mendelssohn's 'St. Paul'—only
two years after that work had made its first appearance
at Düsseldorf. For reasons which we are unable
to discover the Sacred Music Society ceased to exist in
1849. Possibly the musical public of New York were
not overly inclined toward oratorio, and possibly also
the society suffered from the competition of a number
of rival organizations. Most of these, such as 'The
Academy of Church Music,' were formed out of church
choirs and very evidently aspired to rival the fame
of the Sacred Music Society. None of them, however,
attained any success. Their effect, indeed, was if anything,
pernicious, for what New York then needed in
its musical affairs was concentration rather than expansion.</p>

<p>For a short time New York possessed a Handel and
Haydn Society which originated in a number of oratorio
performances gotten up to finance the rebuilding
of the Zion Church. This was before the day of the
Sacred Music Society. The Musical Fund, already mentioned,
seems to have been chiefly an orchestral organization,
notwithstanding the fact that, as Dr. Ritter
points out, it gave monthly rehearsals for 'the display
of the glee and solo talent' of the city. A concert given
by it in 1830 included the overture to Mozart's 'Magic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Flute,' an overture of Winter, a pianoforte solo, a clarinet
concerto, and a trumpet concerto(!). We find that
at its concert in 1836 the Musical Fund had a very
well balanced orchestra of thirty-eight instruments and
performed, among other things, the overtures to Rossini's
'Sémiramide' and 'William Tell.' Handel, Haydn,
Mozart, Gluck, Beethoven, Rossini, and Weber all
figured on the society's programs, and on one occasion
it presented Beethoven's 'Eroica,' arranged for septet.</p>

<p>About this time there seems to have been a number
of musical societies among the German population of
New York, which was beginning to assume large proportions.
Chief of these was the Concordia, which was
devoted to the improvement of instrumental and vocal
music. For a short time the Concordia was conducted
by Daniel Schlesinger, a native of Hamburg and a pupil
of Ferdinand Ries, who exercised considerable influence
on musical life in New York during his few years
in the city. Many semi-private clubs for the cultivation
of various branches of music also began to make
their appearance, but they are of no particular importance,
except in so far as they testify to the growth
of a serious interest in musical matters.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It is quite impossible to say when and where the first
musical society made its appearance in New England.
Though both Mr. Elson and Dr. Ritter assert that the
Stoughton Musical Society was founded in 1786 its
right of priority is not apparent. Even if it had its beginning
in the singing school which Billings taught at
Stoughton in 1774, it still must yield precedence to the
St. Cecilia and Orpheus societies of Charleston, the Orpheus
Club of Philadelphia, and the Harmonic Society<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
of New York—all of which were in existence before
the latter date.</p>

<p>Mr. Sonneck thinks that some sort of musical society
existed in Boston as early as 1761. Certainly an Aretinian
Society existed there in 1782, as we know from
the announcement of a concert in which it took part.
Apparently it was devoted to the cultivation of sacred
choral music. An organization known as the Musical
Society was founded in Boston some time before 1786.
In that year it gave a concert of 'Sacred Musick, vocal
and instrumental—for the benefit and relief of the poor
prisoners confined in the jail of this town.' Apparently
William Selby was conductor of the society, at
least during the years 1786-88, and a regular series of
subscription concerts were given every season until
1790, when the society seems to have gone out of existence.
There must have been other societies in Boston
at the same time, for we find that the proceeds of a
concert held in 1787 were to be devoted to the rebuilding
of the Meeting House in Hollis Street, 'agreeably
to the generous intentions of the Musical <em>Societies</em> in
this town who have projected this concert.' Some of
these may have been founded before the Musical Society.</p>

<p>The Stoughton Society, of which so much has been
made in the histories, is of importance chiefly because
it was the first society that we know of which was
formed among the people and not among cultured
amateurs and professional musicians. Otherwise it
is of slight interest. It did nothing particularly noteworthy
and we cannot even say that it was an organization
of high artistic efficiency. The fact that its nucleus
was a singing class of Billings is hardly an endorsement
of its quality, for there is no evidence that
Billings possessed any qualifications as a trainer of
choruses. He was still primitive enough to include female
voices in the tenor part. Nevertheless, as Deacon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Samuel Tolman informs us, the Stoughton Musical
Society was 'large and respectable' and was 'attended
with spirit.' Its fame was great throughout Massachusetts
and only once was its supremacy questioned. The
incident is related by Mr. Elson as follows: 'Many
clergymen in following the good old fashion of "exchanging
pulpits," had become familiar with the excellent
church music of Stoughton, and sounded its praise
abroad. The singers of the first parish of Dorchester,
Massachusetts, took umbrage at this and challenged
the Stoughton vocalists to a trial of skill. The gauntlet
was at once taken up, and the contest took place in a
large hall in Dorchester, many of the leading Bostonians
coming out to witness it. The Dorchester choristers
were male and female, and had the assistance of
a bass viol. The Stoughton party consisted of twenty
selected male voices, without instruments, led by the
president of the Stoughton Musical Society, Elijah Dunbar,
a man of dignified presence and of excellent voice.
The Dorchester singers began with a new anthem. The
Stoughtonians commenced with Jacob French's "Heavenly
Vision," the author of which was their fellow
townsman. When they finally sang, without books,
Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus" the Dorchestrians gave
up the contest and gracefully acknowledged defeat.' At
least the choristers of Massachusetts were enthusiastic
and sincere, and for their enthusiasm and sincerity one
can forgive them many faults.</p>

<p>How many musical societies existed in Boston during
the last years of the eighteenth century we cannot say.
There seems to have been a number of them. In 1789,
during the visit of Washington to Boston, 'an Oratorio
or Concert of Sacred Musick' was given in which the
choruses of the oratorio of Jonah were sung by the
Independent Musical Society. There is no evidence of
the dates at which this society began or ended its existence,
but it must have been a fairly efficient organization.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
There was no lack of competent musicians in
Boston at that time, and choral singing especially seems
to have been in high favor with a goodly share of the
population. The society of the Sons of Apollo, which
existed in 1795, was probably a vocal organization
also, though we know nothing about it. Boston possessed
a Philharmonic Society which was founded
probably before 1799. Possibly Gottlieb Graupner, one
of the most prominent figures in the early musical life
of Boston, was among its founders, and it seems likely
that it was identical with the Philharmonic Society
which is supposed to have been founded by Graupner
and his friends in 1810 or 1811. According to Mr. J. S.
Dwight, author of a 'History of Music in Boston,' the
Philharmonic was 'simply a social meeting, held on
Saturday evenings, when, in their small way, they practised
Haydn's symphonies.' This statement, however,
does not square with the fact that the society gave
regular concerts and was described by the musical
journal, 'Euterpeiad,' as a 'useful nursery of music.'
Its last concert took place in 1824 and apparently it
went out of existence in that year.</p>

<p>During the last few years of the eighteenth and the
first decades of the nineteenth centuries musical societies
began to spring up in the smaller cities throughout
the country. Very little information concerning
them has come to light, but it is probable that research
will finally disclose a surprising amount of
serious musical activity in places which so far have
escaped mention in our musical histories. The impression
that musical culture in early America was confined
to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston
has taken firm root and is confirmed by most of
the evidence on the subject which has appeared. But
research in American musical history has for the most
part been extremely superficial and determined in its
direction by preconceived impressions which are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
wholly one-sided. Such special studies in early American
musical history as have been made—those of Mr.
O. G. Sonneck, for example—have exploded many longstanding
fallacies and misconceptions and undoubtedly
further research will clear the field of other myths
now generally accepted as incontestable.</p>

<p>There was a St. Cæcilia Society at Newport, R. I.,
in 1793, and we find mention in 1797 of the anniversary
meeting of the Concord Musical Society. What the
nature of these societies was we can only guess. They
were undoubtedly conscious attempts to organize all
the music lovers of these towns into compact bodies
for the better promotion and enjoyment of their favorite
art. It is our conviction that dozens of such societies
existed in the smaller towns throughout the country.
In fact, it would seem that sometimes several societies
co-existed within a very small area—at least
in New England—and formed themselves into associations.
We have an instance in the case of the Essex
Musical Association of Massachusetts, which was
founded in 1797. A copy of its constitution is preserved
in the Roston Athenæum. In 1821 the 'Euterpeiad'
woke up to the fact that there was a very large
amount of musical activity throughout the country.
'During the last week,' it says, 'we noticed the following
musical performances that were to take place in the
present month of May: A concert of sacred music by
the Beethoven Society at Portland (Me.), a grand concert
at Augusta (Ga.), a select oratorio at Providence
by the Psallion Society, a grand concert of music by
the Philadelphia Musical Fund, the grand Oratorio the
"Creation" by the Harmonic Society of Baltimore, a
performance of sacred music by the New Hampshire
Musical Society at Hanover, in Boston an instrumental
and vocal concert for the benefit of Mr. Ostinelli, and
a public oratorio by the Handel and Haydn Society.'</p>

<p>About this time there existed in Dartmouth College
a Handel Society, which is notable as having been the
first serious attempt by an American college to promote
musical culture. It was also the last for a considerable
period. Concerning this society Dr. Ritter
quotes the following from a letter written to him by
Dr. A. G. Brown, president of Hamilton College: 'The
aims of the society were of the best. A good working
library of the best musical works then attainable was
procured, including such works as the "Messiah," the
"Creation," The Handel and Haydn Society Collection
of Anthems, the old Colony Collection, and other music
of like kind. This was carefully studied by the Society,
and at the regular weekly meetings carefully
sung.... Members of the society were chosen after
due examination, and counted it an honor to be members
of the association. Ladies were admitted as honorary
members. And I have never heard better church-music
than from that society at some period of its existence.
Its influence did not stop within the walls of
the college, but was widely diffused, and continued
beyond college life.' Unfortunately its influence did
not continue for very long.</p>

<p>Without doubt there were many musical societies
in Boston during the early years of the nineteenth century,
but, with the exception of the Philharmonic Society,
we have been able to discover only the Massachusetts
Musical Society, formed in 1807 'for improving
the mode of performing sacred music.' It would appear
that this society confined its activities exclusively
to hymns, with the natural result that few members
were attracted to it. It ceased to exist in 1810. Whatever
other societies may have existed in Boston were
completely overshadowed by the founding of the Handel
and Haydn Society in 1815. This famous organization
antedates several of the societies we have already
mentioned, but the greater part of its career is covered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>by a later period. We consequently defer treatment
of it to the chapter dealing with these important
modern societies, of which it may be said to have been
the first.</p>

<p>Accepting the year 1750 as the earliest in which indisputable
records appear of opera in New York, writers
on American musical history pass over the remainder
of the century with a few brief references and escape
with evident relief to the arrival of García's Italian
troupe in 1825.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This willingness to let the dust lie
undisturbed on certain phases of our musical development
is hardly justifiable in the present instance, for
undoubtedly these writers were well aware that opera
in America during the eighteenth century was not such
an infrequent and sporadic thing as to deserve no extended
mention. Mr. H. E. Krehbiel, in his anecdotic
and entertaining 'Chapters of Opera,' writes: 'There
are traces of ballad opera in America in the early decades
of the eighteenth century, and there can exist no
doubt at all that French and Italian operas were given
in some form, perhaps, as a rule, in the adapted form
which prevailed in the London theatres until far into
the nineteenth century, before the year 1800, in the
towns and cities of the Eastern seaboard which were
in most active communication with Great Britain.'</p>

<p>If ballad operas were known in America in the early</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>decades of the eighteenth century and French and Italian
operas were given before the beginning of the nineteenth,
it is surely worth while to consider what part
they played in the musical life of the country. The
subject, of course, is bristling with difficulties. Information
is scarce and not easily accessible. Much of
the difficulty is due to the fact that before the nineteenth
century there were no opera companies, in our
sense. Operatic performances were given by regular
theatrical companies whose repertory was made up
partly of straight drama and partly of opera. Artistic
versatility was a characteristic of the period, and performers
like Mrs. Oldmixon and Miss Broadhurst were
prominent not only on the dramatic and operatic stage,
but also on the concert platform. Our search for the
beginnings of opera, therefore, lead us naturally to
early records of the American theatre, and an examination
of these elucidates some interesting facts.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The first mention of theatrical performances in
America is found in the whimsical autobiography of
the mercurial Tony Aston—'Gentleman, Lawyer, Poet,
Actor, Soldier, Sailor, Exciseman, Publican; in England,
Scotland, Ireland, New York, East and West Jersey,
Maryland, Virginia (on both sides Cheesapeek),
North and South Carolina, South Florida, Bahamas,
Jamaica, Hispaniola, and often a Coaster by all the
same.' In the 'beginning of Queen Anne's reign,' he
tells us, he arrived at Port Royal Harbor where Governor
Moore was about to start on an expedition against
St. Augustine. This was in September, 1702. Tony
accompanied Moore and returned with him to Charleston
in January, 1703. 'Well,' he says, 'we arrived in
Charles-Town, full of Lice, Shame, Poverty, Nakedness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
and Hunger:—I turned Player and Poet and wrote one
Play on the Subject of the Country.' We may assume,
therefore, that Charleston witnessed theatrical performances
in 1703. In the same year the redoubtable
Tony went to New York. 'There,' he says, 'I lighted
of my old Acquaintance Jack Charlton, Fencing Master,
... after acting, writing, courting, fighting that
Winter ... my kind Captain Davis ... gave me free
passage for Virginia....' Apparently, then, there
were theatrical performances in New York in the winter
of 1703-04.</p>

<p>Whether these and the performances in Charleston
were the beginning of the theatre in America, we cannot
say, nor do we know if they included operas. Quite
probably they did. The autobiography from which we
have quoted prefaced the published edition of Tony
Aston's 'Fool's Opera' and it has been inferred that his
work was played during Aston's visit to America. As
it was published several years after his return to England
there is not much reason to believe that New York
or Charleston heard it, but Aston's evident interest in
works of the kind would indicate that he exhibited his
talent in such entertainments while he was in this country.
It may, however, be pointed out that opera was
not in high favor in England at that time. Beginning
with 'The Siege of Rhodes' in 1656 opera was the chief
form of theatrical entertainment until the end of the
Commonwealth. For some peculiar reason—perhaps
Cromwell's love of music—it was tolerated in spite of
the ban on the theatres. But after the Restoration the
drama came into its own again, and with Congreve,
Wycherley, Vanburgh, and others catering brilliantly
to the taste of the times, opera was temporarily neglected.
Interest in it revived under Queen Anne, with
the coming of Handel and the Italian opera, but, except
for the temporary vogue of ballad-opera, following
the production of 'The Beggar's Opera' in 1728, English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
opera failed to attract the popular favor. Indeed, it
never reached a point where it deserved to attract
favor. Except for a few weak efforts in the Italian
recitative style English opera before the ballad opera
was chiefly drama with incidental music. The idea
was popular in Elizabethan times, as we may see from
Shakespeare's plays. In the operas of the Commonwealth
and Restoration periods the musical side was
more emphasized, but the play was the thing, and there
was no Shakespeare or Jonson or Marlowe or Beaumont
and Fletcher to endow the thing with life.</p>

<p>So that whatever operatic performances may have
resulted from Tony Aston's visit to America could not
be of any importance, though they might be of some
historical interest. One wonders if Tony's regrettable
departure from these shores left America theatrically
barren. Many years pass before we discover any sign
of life. Then from Jones's 'Present State of Virginia,'
published in London in 1724, we learn that a playhouse
existed in Williamsburg, Va., at least as early as 1722.
Ten years later New York saw the opening of a New
Theatre in the building of a gentleman with the explosive
appellation of Rip Van Dam. Its name would
suggest that another theatre existed previously in New
York. We cannot say what operas, if any, were given
there, but probably the Gray-Pepusch 'Beggar's Opera,'
Hill's 'The Devil to Pay,' and Fielding's 'Flora, or Hob
in the Well,' were produced. At this period the ballad
opera was enjoying its vogue in England, and fashions
both on and off the English stage were faithfully copied
in America. Almost until the end of the century ballad
operas remained very popular in this country. They
had very little in common with opera as we understand
it and have no real place in the evolution of the art-form.
The music rarely was written especially for
them, but was arranged from existing compositions,
especially from English, Irish, and Scotch folk-tunes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Occasionally the 'composer' showed real skill in making
his adaptations, as Dr. Pepusch did in the 'Beggar's
Opera,' but more frequently still the music was singularly
inept and the whole entertainment bordered
closely on extravaganza.</p>

<p>We find that 'Flora, or Hob in the Well,' was performed
at the Courtroom, Charleston, in 1735, and that
the New Theatre in the same city also produced 'Flora,'
as well as 'The Devil to Pay,' in 1736. New York probably
was giving similar performances at the same time,
but we can discover nothing definite on the subject
until 1739, when we note that at Henry Holt's Long
Room there was performed 'A New Pantomime Entertainment
in Grotesque Characters, call'd the Adventures
of Harlequin and Scaramouch, or the Spaniard
Trick'd. To which will be added an Optick'—whatever
that was. A company of actors appeared in Philadelphia
in 1749, but their advent inspired the city magistrates
to 'take the most effectual measures for suppressing
the disorder.' The unfortunate artists whose
presence constituted a disorder then went to New York,
where they fitted up a building of the Hon. Rip Van
Dam as the 'Theatre in Nassau Street.' There, in 1750
and 1751, they gave a number of operatic performances,
including Fielding's 'Mock Doctor,' 'The Beggar's
Opera,' 'The Devil to Pay,' Cibber's 'Damon and
Philida,' Fielding's 'Virgin Unmask'd,' 'Flora,' and
'Colin and Phœbe.' In 1751 they went South and, as
the New York Company of Comedians, obtained from
Acting Governor Lee of Virginia permission to build
a theatre in Williamsburg. They played at Fredericksburg
in 1752 and in the same year, as the Company of
Comedians from Virginia, opened the New Theatre in
Annapolis, Md., with 'The Beggar's Opera.' They also
gave the 'Virgin Unmask'd,' the 'Mock Doctor,' 'Damon
and Philida,' and 'The Devil to Pay.' Then, metamorphosed
into the Company of Comedians from Annapolis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
they appeared in upper Marlborough, where they
gave 'The Beggar's Opera,' 'With Instrumental Music to
each Air, given by a Set of private Gentlemen.' We
have been unable to follow them further. Part of the
original New York company to which they belonged
remained in that city and formed the nucleus of a new
company which in 1751-52 gave a number of operas
at the Nassau Street Theatre, including Carey's 'Honest
Yorkshireman.'</p>

<p>Hallam's London Company of Comedians, subsequently
the American Company and later the old
American Company, continued the work of supplying
Americans with regular theatrical performances, including
operas. We have been unable to follow their
activities in detail. In 1765 New York heard the pantomime
ballad 'Harlequin's Vagaries,' perhaps the 'Harlequin
Faustus' of Rich, with music by Gaillard. Three
years later was given Bickerstaff's 'Love in a Village,'
the music adapted by Arne from his own compositions
and from the works of Handel, Boyce, Howard, Baildon,
Festing, Geminiani, Galuppi, Giardini, Paradies,
Abos and Agus. Everything was grist to the ballad-opera
mill. Bickerstaff's 'The Maid of the Mill,' with
music by Dr. S. Arnold, was played in New York in
1775.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Theatrical activities were naturally curtailed severely
during the war, but with the establishment of peace
there was a great revival. After the Revolution, indeed,
the popularity of the theatre became much greater and
more widespread than it ever had been before. And
coincident with the popularity of the theatre came the
popularity of opera. Even in Boston the old prejudice
against the theatres began to disappear, though the blue
laws of 1750 were still in force. Several attempts were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
made at various times to circumvent these laws by
presenting operas under the guise of concerts, and the
resulting performances must occasionally have been
wonderfully concocted. We find an announcement in
1770 of 'A vocal entertainment of three acts. The songs
(which are numerous) are taken from a new celebrated
opera, call'd "Lionel and Clarissa."' An entry in the
diary of John Rowe during the same year reads: 'In
the evening I went to the Concert Hall to hear Mr. Joan
read the Beggar's Opera and sing the songs.' In 1792
Alexander gave in Boston 'a musical entertainment
called the Poor Soldier delivered,' and from that time
forward the friends of opera in Boston met with no
opposition, though it was long before Boston became
an operatic city.</p>

<p>In the meantime Maria Storer was winning fame
throughout the country as a ballad opera singer. Such
pleasant and innocuous pieces as 'Thomas and Sally,'
'Dorcas and Squire,' and 'Lionel and Clarissa' were
very popular at the time, and old favorites like the
'Beggar's Opera' and 'The Devil to Pay' held their own
with a vitality that was surprising. The fact is that
the American people, exhausted by the labor and suffering
of the war, were in the state of mind now generally
ascribed to 'the tired business man,' and the English
ballad opera was just the sort of light entertainment
they needed. English opera retained its popularity,
especially in New York, until well into the nineteenth
century; but from about the year 1790 it was
forced to compete with French and Italian opera introduced
by refugees from France and St. Domingo, and
gradually it lost ground until eventually it disappeared
completely.</p>

<p>Between 1789 and 1793 there were given at concerts
in Philadelphia compositions by Rousseau, Dalayrac,
Gluck, Paesiello, Monsigny, Sacchini, and Cimarosa,
and it is not improbable that operas by these composers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
were also given, though we find no mention of the
fact. The first unquestionable record of a French or
Italian opera in this country is the performance of
Pergolesi's <em>Serva Padrona</em>, under the title of 'The Mistress
and Maid,' given by a French company at Baltimore
in 1790. In 1791-92 Dibdin's 'The Deserter,'
adapted from <em>Le Déserteur</em> of Monsigny, was given in
New York, and it may be of interest to note that Sheridan
and Linley's 'Duenna' was given in the same season.
Charleston, always an enterprising city musically,
harbored a company of French comedians who arrived
from St. Domingo in 1794, and enjoyed performances
of operas by Rousseau, Grétry, Cimarosa, Paesiello, and
other composers then popular in Europe.</p>

<p>In the meantime there existed a healthy rivalry between
New York and Philadelphia touching the excellence
of their respective operatic organizations. Wignell
and Reinagle opened the New Theatre in Philadelphia
in 1793 and gave especial prominence to opera.
As might be expected when Reinagle was at the helm,
the performances reached a high standard of artistic
merit. Reinagle himself was one of the conductors and
among them also was Filippo Trajetto, whom we have
already met in the concert life of Boston. Mrs. Oldmixon,
Miss Broadhurst and Miss Brett seem to have
been the vocal stars. In New York James Hewitt,
George Geilfert or Gilfert, and Francis Hodgkinson directed
the musical activities of the theatre and exerted
themselves strenuously to surpass Reinagle's organization.
Dunlap writes in his 'History of the American
Theatre': 'We have noticed the improvement made by
Mr. Hodgkinson in the orchestra at New York, improvements
rendered necessary by the excellence of this
branch of theatrical arrangement in the rival company
of Philadelphia. (The orchestra at Philadelphia, under
the direction of Reinagle, who sat at the harpsichord,
was much superior to that of New York.) Instead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the "one Mr. Pelham" and his harpsichord, or the single
fiddle of Mr. Hewlett, performers of great skill filled the
bands of the two rival cities. In New York the musicians
were principally French; most of these gentlemen
who had seen better days,—some driven from
Paris by the revolution, some of them nobles, some
officers in the army of the king, others who had sought
refuge from the devastation of St. Domingo.' Certainly,
the debt of the United States to France is heavy
in many directions.</p>

<p>Dr. Ritter has been at pains to compile a list of the
English operas given in New York between 1793 and
1823. The former year saw Shield's 'The Farmer,'
Storace's comic opera, 'No Song, No Supper,' and Dibdin's
'The Waterman.' During the season 1793-94 there
were played Dibdin's 'Lionel and Clarissa,' and 'The
Wedding Ring,' Arnold's 'Inkle and Yarico,' Shield's
'Poor Soldier,' 'Love in a Camp,' and 'Rosina,' 'The
Beggar's Opera,' 'No Song, No Supper,' and 'The Devil
to Pay.' Dibdin's 'Quaker,' Arnold's 'The Children of
the Wood,' Storace's 'The Haunted Tower.' Carter's
'The Rival Candidate' and 'Macbeth' with music were
given in 1794-95. In 1796 were produced 'Rosina,' 'The
Children in the Wood,' 'The Maid of the Mill,' Reeve's
'The Purse,' Shield's 'Robin Hood,' 'No Song, No Supper,'
'The Haunted Tower,' 'The Surrender of Calais,'
Arnold's 'The Mountaineer,' Altwood's 'The Prisoner,'
'Poor Soldier,' 'The Padlock,' and an English version of
Rousseau's 'Pygmalion.' What is probably the first
American opera was produced in New York on April
18 of the same year. It is called 'The Archers, or the
Mountaineers of Switzerland,' and was written by Benjamin
Carr to a libretto by William Dunlap. In 1796
also appeared 'Edwin and Angelina,' composed by Victor
Pelissier to a libretto by one Smith. This has often
been spoken of as the first American opera, but apparently
it saw the light some months later than Carr's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
work, and, in any case, Pelissier was not an American.
Another opera from his pen, to a libretto by William
Dunlap, called 'The Vintage,' was produced in New
York in 1799—but we are anticipating.</p>

<p>The seasons of 1797 and 1798 seem to have been
rather poor in New York. Dr. Ritter notes only Storace's
'Siege of Belgrade' and Shield's 'Fontainebleau'
in the former year, and Mrs. Oldmixon in 'Inkle and
Yarico' in the latter year. Nothing is mentioned for
1799 and 1800 except Pelissier's 'The Vintage' and an
opera composed by Hewitt to a libretto by Dunlap. In
1801 appeared Kelly's 'Bluebeard,' Reeve and Mazzinghi's
'Paul and Virginia,' 'The Duenna,' Shield's 'Sprig
of Laurel,' and Kelly's 'The Hunter of the Alps.' Then
there is a hiatus until 1807 and 1808, when we find
'The Siege of Belgrade,' Dr. Arnold's 'The Review,'
Kelly's 'We Fly by Night' and 'Cinderella,' 'Forty
Thieves,' Storace's 'Lodoiska,' and Mazzinghi's 'The
Exile.' Another famine followed until 1812 when 'Bluebeard'
was produced. The years 1813-14 saw Henry
Bishop's 'Athis,' 'The Farmer and His Wife,' and 'The
Miller and His Men.' Between 1814 and 1819 are noted
'The Poor Soldier,' 'Love in a Village,' 'Review,' 'Siege
of Belgrade,' 'Bluebeard,' 'Lodoiska,' 'The Maid of the
Mill,' 'Castle of Andalusia,' 'The Beggar's Opera,'
'Lionel and Clarissa,' 'Fontainebleau,' Kelly's 'Bride of
Abydos,' and 'Rob Roy.' From this time on the vogue
of English opera rapidly declined and there are signs
of a growing interest in Italian, French, and German
opera, though New York had little opportunity of hearing
such before 1825. An opera called 'The Barber of
Seville,' adapted by Bishop probably from Rossini's
work, was produced in 1819-20. Such adaptations seem
to have been not infrequent, and it can hardly be said
that there was any artistic excuse for them. A similar
adaptation of Mozart's <em>Nozze di Figaro</em>, made by
Bishop, was played in New York in 1823 and two years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
later there was presented a mutilated version of Weber's
<em>Freischütz</em>. It is worthy of note that John Howard
Paine's 'Clari, the Maid of Milan,' containing the song
'Home, Sweet Home,' was produced in New York on
November 12, 1823. The opera itself soon melted into
oblivion, but the song has survived as one of the most
widely popular lyrics ever composed. Other operas
given in New York between 1819 and 1825 include
Braham's 'English Fleet,' 'The Deserter,' Bishop's
'Henry IV,' Kelly's 'Russian,' Bishop's 'Montrose,' 'The
Duenna,' and Bishop's 'Maid Marian.'</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One turns with relief to contemporary opera in New
Orleans. The preëminence of New Orleans as an operatic
centre among American cities of the late eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries was as marked as
that of New York has been in recent times, though its
population was only a fraction of that possessed by
New York, Philadelphia, or Boston. Of course, New
Orleans really was not an American city and did not
contain any considerable number of American residents
until many years after the Louisiana Purchase.
It was, in effect, a French provincial city with a metropolitan
flavor due to its position as the head of a rich
and important colony. When one remembers the notably
gregarious instincts of Frenchmen and their intense
and tenacious devotion to the homeland, it is easy
to understand how in New Orleans they reproduced as
far as possible the social and artistic conditions of
Paris. The thoroughly French character of New Orleans
and its life remained unchanged during the Spanish
régime, and even the purchase effected no appreciable
change until many years had passed. This was
especially so at the opera, which even now remains a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
thoroughly French institution, and it has been said that
until after the Civil War American visitors to the opera
were very rare. Indeed, opera is a form of art which
has always appealed less to native Americans than to
foreign-born citizens.</p>

<p>Information on the actual beginnings of opera in
New Orleans are rather scanty, but we know that a
regular troupe of French comedians and singers appeared
there in 1791, and it is to be assumed that they
presented operas of Grétry, Gluck, Dalayrac, Monsigny,
and others, more or less efficiently. Opera, drama, and
ballet in the best French manner were given at M.
Croquet's Théâtre St. Philippe in 1808. Another theatre
was built in St. Peter Street in 1810, and among the
operas given there in that and the following year were
Paesiello's 'Barber of Seville' and Zingarelli's 'Romeo
and Juliet.' The arrival of John Davis in 1811 with a
troupe from San Domingo marks one of the real epochs
in American operatic activities. Davis built the Théâtre
d'Orléans in 1813 and, when it was burned down four
years later, he rebuilt it at a cost of $180,000. This
new theatre was by far the finest and best appointed in
America. Opera was given there three times a week by
a regular opera company, and not by artists who combined
opera with the spoken drama, as was customary
elsewhere in America. After the death of John Davis
his son Pierre conducted the theatre for twenty-five
years. The glories of French opera in New Orleans
during those years must await mention in a later chapter,
but, remarkable as they were, they hardly surpassed
the achievements of the elder Davis during a period
when opera elsewhere in America offered little of interest
or artistic importance. The works of Rossini, Mozart,
Spontini, Méhul, Grétry, Gluck, and other of the
most eminent operatic composers were given in the best
manner by competent orchestras and ensembles, by
distinguished conductors and soloists. Beginning with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
García's visit in 1825, New York received frequent attentions
from foreign opera companies, and soon was
enjoying an operatic life which has now grown to proportions
surpassed by few cities in the world, but at
least half of the nineteenth century had passed away
before New Orleans lost its proud position as the real
home of opera in America.</p>

began to lose some of its hold on New York audiences
during the first years of the nineteenth century. Symptomatic
of an awakening desire for other forms of operatic
entertainment were the adaptations of <em>Il Barbiere
di Siviglia</em>, <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, <em>Der Freischütz</em>, and
similar favorites of the contemporary European stage.
There existed in New York at that time a society of
some brilliance, wealth, and culture—a modest replica
of the upper circles of London, Paris, and Vienna. In
these latter cities the opera flourished as a social function;
it was one of the most important foci of fashion.
Obviously New York could not remain long without
such an addition to its fashionable life. Nor could
English opera serve the purpose, for English opera had
ceased to be the thing in London. Society had taken
up Italian opera, and only Italian opera was then <em>de
rigueur</em>. Why New York did not have Italian opera
at an earlier date it is difficult to say. Possibly the field
did not seem sufficiently tempting to the European
<em>entrepreneurs</em>; possibly New York society had not yet
affected that cosmopolitan air which had come to be the
distinguishing mark of the socially elect elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Whatever factors operated to keep Italian opera out
of New York, the situation had altered sufficiently in
1825 to tempt Manuel García<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> over with an opera company
in that year. To be sure, García was past his
prime as a singer and, except for his daughter, Maria,
and the basso Angrisani, his company was worse than
indifferent. But his coming marked the beginning of
an epoch in the operatic history of this country. He
gave New Yorkers a first taste of the best in contemporary
opera and inaugurated a fashion which on the
whole has been productive of very brilliant results. In
spite of the fact that opera is not and never has been
in New York a diversion for the proletariat; in spite
of the fact that it has been to a large extent a vehicle
for ostentation; in spite of the fact that its conduct
has not always been guided by broad artistic ideals—in
spite of all these and other drawbacks New York
has set for itself a standard of operatic achievement
which is scarcely surpassed by any city in the world.
The value of this standard in the promotion of musical
culture is questionable; that it subserves the best interests
of art is not certain. But at least New York must
be awarded the credit of doing such operatic work as
it has chosen to do in a finished and magnificent manner.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The foundation of this work was laid by Manuel
García at the Park Theatre in 1825. This house was
opened in 1798 and was rebuilt in 1820 after its destruction
by fire. It was the house of English opera as well
as of the spoken drama prior to the García invasion.
Apparently the <em>pièce de résistance</em> on García's contemplated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
program was an authentic version of Rossini's
<em>Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, and it does not seem that he
had in project anything more exacting than this and
other light examples of the reigning Italian school.
But in New York he ran foul of the old idealist, Lorenzo
da Ponte, librettist of Mozart's <em>Don Giovanni</em>, <em>Le nozze
di Figaro</em>, and <em>Così fan tutte</em>, now condemned to the
obscure fate of a small merchant and teacher of Italian.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Da Ponte persuaded García to put on <em>Don Giovanni</em>
and succeeded in obtaining the necessary reinforcements
to make such a production possible. The
production of <em>Don Giovanni</em> was really an event, but
whether the people of New York accepted it as such
we cannot say. García also presented Rossini's <em>Barbiere
di Siviglia</em>, <em>Tancredi</em>, <em>Il Turco in Italia</em>, <em>Sémiramide</em>,
and <em>La Cenerentola</em>, besides two operas of his
own composition entitled <em>L'Amante astuto</em> and <em>La Figlia
dell'Aria</em>. The beauty, art, and magnetism of the
youthful Maria García made the season a success and
started the fashion of operatic idols which still influences
to a large extent the success or failure of that
form of art. Otherwise the season was undistinguished.</p>

<p>García went to Mexico in 1826, but his daughter remained
in New York and sang in English opera at the
recently erected New York Theatre. She also sang
in the choir of Grace Church—a strikingly unusual proceeding
for an artist who had already won international
renown. For over five years there was no more
Italian opera in New York, nor was there, indeed, a
regular operatic season of any kind. English ballad
opera, however, again came into favor for a time and
there were also performances in English of such works
as Auber's <em>Masaniello</em>, Boieldieu's <em>La dame blanche</em>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>and Mozart's <em>Il flauto magico</em>—all wretched adaptations
of the originals. Seemingly the operatic managers
of that time had all the peculiar vices of the
musical comedy producer of to-day. The scores of
Mozart, Auber, Rossini and other masters were subjected
to incredible mutilations, and inapt interpolations
of every kind were used to catch the popular
taste. If the following picture of musical life in New
York is not overdrawn it certainly paints an extraordinary
state of affairs. It is taken from a letter written
by a visiting German musician to the <em>Cæcilia</em>, a musical
journal of Mayence.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>'Here the musical situation is the following: New
York has four theatres—Park Theatre, Bowery Theatre,
Lafayette Theatre, and Chatham Theatre. Dramas,
comedies, and spectacle pieces, also the Wolf's Glen
scene from <em>Der Freyschütz</em>, but without singing, as
melodrama, and small operettas are given. The performance
of a whole opera is not to be thought of.
However, they have no sufficient orchestra to do it.
The orchestras are very bad indeed, as bad as it is
possible to imagine, and incomplete. Sometimes they
have two clarinets, which is a great deal; sometimes
there is only one first instrument. Of bassoons, oboes,
trumpets, and kettle drums, one never sees a sight.
However, once in a while a first bassoon is employed.
Oboes are totally unknown in this country. Only one
oboist exists in North America and he is said to live
in Baltimore.</p>

<p>'In spite of this incompleteness they play symphonies,
and grand overtures, and if a gap occurs they think this
is only of passing importance, provided it rattles away
again afterward....</p>

<p>'Performances take place six times a week in these
theatres. Sunday is a day of rest. The performances
commence at half past seven, and last until twelve,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>sometimes till one. Rope-dancers, or one who is a
good clown—even if he be able to execute only tolerably
well a few jumps that resemble a dance, and can
make many grotesque grimaces,—or one who plays
(all by himself) on the barrel-organ, cymbals, big
drum, Turkish pavilion,—these are the men that help
the manager to fill the treasury, and these people earn
enormous sums.'</p>

<p>At this ebb-tide of music in New York there stood
out in bold relief the venerable figure of Lorenzo da
Ponte, the old idealist, the type of the world's dreamers,
whose achievements are rarely recorded.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'World-losers and world-forsakers<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On whom the pale moon gleams</span><br>
Yet we are the movers and shakers<br>

</div>

<p>Da Ponte had a dream. It was of a permanent Italian
opera in New York, with himself as poet. The
dream was not realized, but it had an important influence.
After five years of endeavor da Ponte succeeded
in inducing a French tenor named Montressor to undertake
a season of opera at the Richmond Hill Theatre.
The season opened in October 6, 1832, but failed
after thirty-five performances. On the whole, it would
seem that the company was a very good one, and it is
hard to explain its failure except on the ground that
New York audiences were still lacking in the faculty
of appreciation. The orchestra was supposed to be the
best that had yet been heard in the city, and, fortunately
for New York, most of its members settled there
after the failure of the enterprise. The operas performed
during Montressor's season were Rossini's <em>Cenerentola</em>
and <em>L'Italiani in Algieri</em>, Bellini's <em>Il Pirata</em>,
and Mercadante's <em>Elisa e Claudio</em>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Montressor's failure, da Ponte still
remained undaunted. He now determined that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
thing really needed was an Italian opera house decked
out with the same social halo as adorned the brilliant
institutions of London and Vienna. He was right. The
Metropolitan Opera House of to-day is just the sort of
institution that da Ponte forecasted, and its success
proves that the old dreamer was no bad prophet.
Through his influence the Italian Opera House was
built on the corner of Church and Leonard Streets at
a cost of $150,000, and with the coöperation of many
of the most eminent citizens. Evidently it was designed
to appeal to the cream of the <em>beau monde</em>. We quote
from the diary of Philip Hone, Esq., sometime mayor
of New York:</p>

<p>'——The house is superb, and the decorations of the
proprietors' boxes (which occupy the whole of the
second tier) are in a style of magnificence which even
the extravagance of Europe has not yet equalled. I
have one-third of box No. 8; Peter Schermerhorn one-third;
James J. Jones one-sixth; William Moore one-sixth.
Our box is fitted up with great taste with light
blue hangings, gilded panels and cornice, armchairs
and a sofa. Some of the others have rich silk ornaments,
some are painted in fresco, and each proprietor
seems to have tried to outdo the rest in comfort and
magnificence. The scenery is beautiful. The dome
and the fronts of the boxes are painted in the most
superb classical designs, and the sofa seats are exceedingly
commodious.'</p>

<p>This resplendent institution was opened on November
18, 1833, under the joint management of da Ponte
and the Chevalier Rivafinoli—the latter being, according
to da Ponte, 'a daring, but imprudently daring, adventurer,
whose failures in London and in Mexico and
Carolina, were the sure forerunners of his failure in
New York.' The season was advertised for forty nights,
but there was a supplementary season of twenty-eight
nights. In addition there were fifteen performances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
given in Philadelphia. Socially and artistically the
season was a distinct success, but financially it was a
failure. The operas performed were Rossini's <em>La gazza
ladra</em>, <em>Il barbiere di Siviglia</em>, <em>La donna del lago</em>, <em>Il
Turco in Italia</em>, <em>Cenerentola</em> and <em>Matilda di Shabran</em>,
Cimarosa's <em>Il matrimonio segreto</em>, Paccini's <em>Gli Arabi
nelli Gallie</em>, and an opera called <em>La casa di Pendere</em>,
by the conductor, Salvioni.</p>

<p>During the same season there was also a period of
English opera at the Park Theatre, where 'Cinderella,'
'The Barber of Seville,' 'The Marriage of Figaro,' 'Artaxerxes,'
'Masaniello,' 'John of Paris,' 'Robert the
Devil' (adapted and arranged), and other works were
produced with Mr. and Mrs. Wood as principal singers.
'The house,' according to the 'American Musical
Journal,' 'was crowded nightly.' The management of
the Park Theatre certainly presented a much more
varied and catholic program than was furnished by
the Italian Opera House; but we suspect shrewdly that
variety was its chief distinction.</p>

<p>When Rivafinoli's enterprise collapsed, the Italian
Opera House was taken over by Porto and Sacchi—the
latter treasurer and the former one of the singers
of the Rivafinoli company. The season opened on
November 10, 1834, with Bellini's <em>La Straniera</em>, and
during its short life Rossini's <em>Eduardo e Christina</em>,
<em>L'Inganno felice</em>, <em>L'Assedio di Corinto</em>, and <em>Mosé in
Egitto</em> were also produced. It collapsed with the sudden
disappearance of the <em>prima donna</em>, Signora Fanti.
The Signora's defection, however, was rather the occasion
than the cause of its untimely end. One is
tempted to say that the Italian Opera House suffered
from too much Rossini. But the real secret of its
failure lay in the fact that it was not in the fashionable
section of the city. The lure of art, reinforced by rich
silk ornaments and paintings in fresco, by 'superb
classical designs' and 'exceedingly commodious' sofa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
seats did not prove sufficiently strong to draw society
from the strictly defined path of its appointed orbit.
The valorous old da Ponte pleaded eloquently, but in
vain. <em>Abyssus abyssum invocat</em>, as he truly complained.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>After a year of vacancy the Italian Opera House went
to James W. Wallack, father of the famous John Lester
Wallack, and after a year of the spoken drama it went
up in smoke. For ten years Italian opera in New York
was as dead as the English queen whose demise is
her chief title to fame. But New York was not wholly
barren of opera during those years. In 1837 came
Madame Caradori-Allan from England to sing in oratorio,
concert, and opera in New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
and elsewhere. She gave some operas at the
Park Theatre in 1838, including Balfe's 'Siege of
Rochelle,' Bellini's <em>La Sonnambula</em>, Rossini's <em>Il Barbiere
di Siviglia</em>, and Donizetti's <em>Elisir d'amore</em>, all in
English. Also in 1838 a company which Dr. Ritter
calls 'the Seguin combination' gave some operatic performances
at the National Theatre. He tells us that
Rooke's opera, 'Amalie, or the Love Test,' was performed
for twelve consecutive nights before crowded
houses.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Noteworthy were the efforts of an English company
who in 1839 gave performances of Beethoven's <em>Fidelio</em>,
Rossini's <em>La Cenerentola</em> and <em>La Gazza ladra</em>, Bellini's
<em>La Sonnambula</em>, Auber's <em>Fra Diavolo</em>, Donizetti's <em>Elisir
d'amore</em>, and Adam's <em>Postilion de Lonjumeau</em>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>
<p>This was by far the choicest operatic menu that had
ever been placed before New Yorkers. The performances
were in English and we are not enlightened as to
their quality; we know only that the venture was not
a success. In 1840 the Woods returned with a season
of operas in English, including <em>La Sonnambula</em>,
<em>Fidelio</em>, and—sublime bathos—the 'Beggar's Opera'!
Later the singer and composer, Braham, beloved of
Englishmen, appeared at the Park Theatre in 'The Siege
of Belgrade,' 'The Devil's Bridge,' 'The Waterman,'
and 'The Cabinet.' Except for the visits of the New
Orleans opera companies, of which we shall speak in
another chapter, these were the only operatic treats
vouchsafed to New Yorkers between the years 1834 and
1844.</p>

<p>In the meantime a gentleman named Ferdinand
Palmo was making quite a reputation as a cook and
proprietor of the <em>Café des Mille Colonnes</em> on Broadway,
near Duane Street. Mr. Palmo suffered from that
ancient delusion known as 'opera for the people,' and
under its influence he spent the accumulated profits of
the <em>Mille Colonnes</em> in remodelling Stoppani's Arcade
Baths, on Chambers Street, into a popular opera house.
There, in 1844, he opened a season of Italian opera
with Bellini's <em>I Puritani</em>. Mr. Palmo was certainly determined
to give New Yorkers the best that could be
obtained. He had Madame Cinti-Damoreau, whom
Fétis described as one of the greatest singers the world
had known; he had a great tenor in Antognini, whom
Richard Grant White compares as a singer to Ronconi
and as an actor to Salvini; he had a very good soprano
in Borghese. In addition he had an orchestra of 'thirty-two
professors.' He survived the first season, but in
the middle of the second the 'thirty-two professors'
went on strike for their wages and the sheriff's minions
descended on the box office receipts, the <em>Mille Colonnes</em>
and everything else attachable that Mr. Palmo possessed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
The attempt at a democratic opera was a fine
and courageous one, but the time was not ripe for such
an effort.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>After Palmo's failure his theatre was taken over by a
new company which included among its principal members
Salvatore Patti and Catarina Barili, the parents of
Carlotta and Adelina Patti. It had a very brief existence
and in 1848 Palmo's Opera House became Burton's
Theatre. In the meantime, however, New York
had been enjoying an assortment of other operas, presented
by various visiting companies. The most important
of these was a French company from New Orleans
which, in 1843, presented <em>La fille du régiment</em>,
<em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, <em>Norma</em>, and <em>Gemma di Vergy</em>—in
French, of course. There were also several English
companies, notably the Seguins, who gave opera in
English at the Park Theatre and elsewhere. In 1844
the Seguin company produced Balfe's 'Bohemian Girl'
for the first time in America.</p>

<p>It has frequently been the lot of New York to be
visited by Italian opera companies from Cuba, Mexico,
and South America. These companies were sometimes
very bad, sometimes indifferent, sometimes very good.
Of the last-named category was the company brought
from Havana by Señor Francesco Marty y Tollens
in 1847. Señor Marty was backed in his enterprise
by James H. Hackett, the actor, and William
Niblo, proprietor of the famous gardens. He had a
very good company, notable chiefly for the fact that its
conductor was Luigi Arditi, composer of <em>Il Bacio</em>—the
'Maiden's Prayer' of aspiring coloraturas. A season
was given at the Park Theatre, after which there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>a number of extra performances at Castle Garden.
The repertory included Verdi's <em>Ernani</em> and <em>I due Foscari</em>,
Bellini's <em>Norma</em> and <em>Sonnambula</em>, Paccini's <em>Saffo</em>,
and Rossini's <em>Mosé in Egitto</em>. Señor Marty returned in
1848,1849, and 1850, with a company which Max Maretzek
described as the greatest ever heard in America.
The famous contrabassist, Bottesini, was musical director
and Arditi remained as conductor. Among the
operas performed were Verdi's <em>Attila</em> and <em>Macbeth</em>,
Meyerbeer's <em>Huguenots</em> and Donizetti's <em>La Favorita</em>.</p>

<p>Opera in English was still given frequently but without
any regularity at various theatres. Madame Anna
Bishop appeared in a number of operas in 1847, and
during the same year W. H. Reeves, brother of the
famous Sims Reeves, made his operatic <em>début</em>. Among
the novelties produced was Wallace's <em>Maritana</em>. In
1850 Madame Anna Thillon appeared in Auber's 'Crown
Diamonds' at Niblo's and two years later Flotow's
'Martha' was produced.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the meantime, however, New York had launched
one of the greatest of operatic enterprises, a direct successor
to the Italian Opera House conceived and carried
out by the old dreamer da Ponte. Palmo's splendid
experiment had only served to show that da Ponte
was right. Democratic opera was a delusion. Opera
in Italian or in any other language foreign to the mass
of the people was foredoomed to failure. Only the
glamour of social prestige could save it. And, just as
opera needed society, so did society need opera. It
was out of the question, of course, that persons of social
pretensions should patronize Palmo's or Niblo's or
Castle Garden or any other place geographically outside
the social sphere and appealing largely to the common
herd. Society is a jewel which shines only in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
appropriate setting. Hence one hundred and fifty gentlemen
of New York's social (and financial) <em>élite</em> got
together and guaranteed to support Italian opera in a
suitable house for five years. On the strength of this
guarantee Messrs. Foster, Morgan and Colles built the
Astor Place Opera House, a theatre seating about 1,800
persons. 'Its principal feature,' said the slightly malicious
Maretzek, 'was that everybody could see, and,
what is of infinitely greater consequence, could be seen.
Never, perhaps, was any theatre built that afforded a
better opportunity for a display of dress.' The Astor
Place Opera House was opened in 1847, with Messrs.
Sanquirico and Patti, late of Palmo's, as lessees, and
Rapetti as leader of the orchestra. They produced
during the season Verdi's <em>Nabucco</em> and <em>Ernani</em>, Bellini's
<em>Beatrice di Tenda</em>, Donizetti's <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em>, and
Mercadante's <em>Il Giuramento</em>. In 1848 the house was
taken over by E. R. Fry, an American, who brought
over Max Maretzek as conductor and gathered together
a fairly good company, including M. and Mme. Laborde.
The operas given were Verdi's <em>Ernani</em>, Bellini's <em>Norma</em>,
and Donizetti's <em>Linda di Chamouni</em>, <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em>,
<em>L'Elisir d'amore</em>, <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, and <em>Roberto
Devereux</em>. Fry made a complete failure, and, judging
by his list, one is impelled to say he deserved it.</p>

<p>In 1849 Maretzek became lessee of the house and began
that chequered career as an <em>impresario</em> which
ended only when the Metropolitan so to speak shut
its newly made doors in his face. Most of his singers
were taken from Fry's company, but he also had some
new ones, among them the Signora Bertucca, who was
included in the famous list which, according to Mr. H.
E. Krehbiel, the redoubtable Max invariably checked
off on his fingers when recounting his services to opera
in New York. Maretzek remained at the Astor Place
Opera House until 1850, and during three seasons gave
<em>Lucia</em>, <em>L'Elisir d'amore</em>, <em>Don Pasquale</em>, <em>Il Barbiere</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
Rossini's <em>Otello</em>, <em>I Puritani</em>, <em>Belisario</em>, <em>Ernani</em>—the list
is tiresomely familiar.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime the Astor Place Opera House was
leased to William Niblo, the backer of Señor Francesco
Marty y Tollens. Niblo's idea in leasing the
opera house was to eliminate it as a competitor. In
pursuance of this idea he engaged one Signor Donetti,
and his troupe of performing dogs and monkeys, whom
he presented to the aristocratic patrons of the institution.
The patrons obtained an injunction against Niblo
on the ground that the exhibition was not respectable
within the meaning of the terms upon which the
house was leased. 'On the hearing to show cause
for this injunction,' says Maretzek, 'Mr. Niblo called
upon Donetti or some of his friends who testified that
his aforesaid dogs and monkeys had in their younger
days appeared before princes and princesses and kings
and queens. Moreover, witnesses were called who declared
under oath that the previously mentioned dogs
and monkeys behaved behind the scenes more quietly
and respectably than many Italian singers. This fact
I feel that I am not called upon to dispute.' Thus the
ambitions and exclusive Astor Place Opera House
ended as a joke. The building was used later as a
library.</p>

<p>There is a peculiar resemblance between opera
houses and human beings. High hopes and ambitions
mark the beginnings of both; but the corrosive influences
of life's practical everyday soon tarnish the shining
metal of their ideals until finally they are reduced
to the dull commonplace that marks the end of all
created things. And, it may be added, in the majority
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>of cases the most powerfully corrosive influence is
money. An instance in point occurred in New York in
1852. It was another dream of democratic opera—or
rather, democratic music—a dream of a great new
institution adapted to American conditions wherein
would germinate and grow to a brilliant flowering the
seeds of a national musical art. Truly a beautiful
dream, and one which, it might seem, should easily
materialize in a country so rich, so young, so eager, so
progressive. A charter was obtained from the state of
New York authorizing the establishment of an 'Academy
of Music for the purpose of cultivating a taste for
music by concerts, operas, and other entertainments,
which shall be accessible to the public at a moderate
charge; by furnishing facilities for instruction in music,
and by rewards of prizes for the best musical compositions.'
American music-lovers were naturally gratified
and Mr. D. H. Fry, a prominent musical critic, ventured
to hope that it might 'yet come to pass that art, in all
its verifications,' would 'be as much esteemed as politics,
commerce, or the military profession. The dignity
of American artists lies in their hands'—meaning, we
presume, the hands of the Academy promoters.</p>

<p>The dignity of American artists lay in very incompetent
hands—incompetent as far as the dignity of American
art was concerned. The commodious new Academy
was leased to Max Maretzek, who sub-leased it to
J. H. Hackett, and it was opened in October, 1854, with
a company headed by Grisi and Mario. The showman
exploitation of great artists existed long before P. T.
Barnum exhibited Jenny Lind. The appearances of
Henrietta Sontag at Niblo's in <em>La fille du régiment</em> in
1850 and of Grisi and Mario at Castle Garden in 1854
were purely and simply showman enterprises.</p>

<p>In January, 1855, Ole Bull, the Norwegian violinist,
took over the management of the Academy, with the
earnest intention of carrying out the high purposes for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
which it was founded. As a first step to that end he
offered a prize of one thousand dollars for the 'best
original grand opera, by an American composer, and
upon a strictly American subject.' The phrase has become
almost a formula. It is unfortunate that idealistic
enterprises in America always seek to fly before
they can walk. There was no American composer
capable of writing an original grand opera on any subject,
neither was there a public opinion cultivated
enough to support such an enterprise as the Academy.
Within two months of Ole Bull's announcement, 'in
consequence of insuperable difficulties,' the Academy
was forced to close and the original grand opera by an
American composer never saw the light. The season
was completed by the Lagrange company from Niblo's,
managed by a committee of stockholders, with Maretzek
as conductor.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>A bright rift in the cloud that hung over operatic
New York at that time was the coming to Niblo's in
1855 of a German company, with Mlle. Lehman (not,
of course, the more famous Lilli Lehmann) as star.
Among the operas presented were Flotow's 'Martha,'
Weber's <em>Der Freischütz</em>, and Lortzing's <em>Czar und Zimmermann</em>.</p>

<p>In the following year the German company added
Mme. Johannsen to its forces, with Carl Bergmann as
conductor, and presented, among other operas, Beethoven's
<em>Fidelio</em>. Bergmann remained as conductor for
several years and did an amount of pioneer work for
German opera in New York the importance of which
has been curiously ignored. It may be mentioned here,
though a little in advance of our narrative, that he introduced
Wagner's <em>Tannhäuser</em> for the first time in
America at the Stadt Theatre, New York, in 1859. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
chorus was supplied by the Arion Männergesangverein.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In 1855 Maretzek produced Rossini's 'William Tell'
and Verdi's <em>Il Trovatore</em> at the Academy. He had a
good company which included the soprano Steffanone—one
of Señor Marty's singers—and the tenor Brignoli,
who became a great favorite with New Yorkers. A
Mr. Payne opened a season of forty nights there in the
fall of 1855 and in the following year Maretzek again
became lessee. He soon quarrelled with the proprietors
of the Academy and went to Boston. In January, 1857,
Maurice Strakosch opened a season of Italian opera
with an indifferent company, but in March Maretzek reappeared
and set up an opposition at Niblo's. The next
few seasons were marked by an amount of activity in
which control of the operatic field was a consideration
paramount to artistic achievement. Maretzek, Strakosch,
and the latter's aide, Bernard Ullman, were the
principals in an amusing campaign which, on more
than one occasion, saw the rival impresarios acting as
partners. Strakosch and Ullman opened the Academy
season in the fall of 1857 with the fascinating Emmilia
Frezzolini in <em>La Sonnambula</em>. Carl Anschütz, later
of the Arion, was conductor. It was really a good season
and, though it saw no novelties, it was redeemed
from the usual hurdy-gurdy category by the production
of <em>Les Huguenots</em> and <em>Robert le Diable</em>. In March,
1858, 'Leonora,' by the American composer W. H. Fry,
was produced at the Academy under the bâton of Carl
Anschütz.</p>

<p>Maretzek, in the meantime, was in Philadelphia with
a company headed by the famous buffo, Roncone. In
1858 he returned to New York and opened a season
at the Academy, while Strakosch took up a stand at
Burton's Theatre. Ullman came from Europe in October,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
bringing with him the saucy and winsome Maria
Piccolomini, whom he advertised as a lineal descendant
of Charlemagne and the great-granddaughter of
Schiller's hero, Max Piccolomini. As a showman Ullman
was second only to the great Barnum. Maretzek
and Ullman joined hands at the Academy in the fall
of 1859 and presented Adelina Patti in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>.</p>

<p>For several years following there is nothing much
to note. The operatic situation was summed up in
the alternate quarrels and reconciliations of Maretzek,
Ullman, and the brothers Maurice, Max, and Ferdinand
Strakosch, all of whom at various times have taken
occasion to speak of the sacrifices they made for Italian
opera in New York. As a matter of fact, opera was to
all of them what the green table is to the confirmed
gambler. Yet they accomplished much, and, though
they relied mainly on the hackneyed list of Rossini,
Donizetti, and Bellini, they introduced New York
opera-goers, during the sixties and seventies, to a number
of novelties. Among these may be mentioned
Meyerbeer's <em>L'Africaine</em>, <em>Le Pardon de Ploërmel</em>, and
<em>L'Étoile du Nord</em>, Verdi's <em>Aïda</em>, Gounod's <em>Faust</em>,
Thomas's <em>Mignon</em>, Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em>, and the <em>Crispino
e la Comare</em> of the Ricci brothers—all in Italian.
Maurice Strakosch was responsible for the presence
in America of Christine Nilsson and of Italo Campanini,
both distinguished artists who held a high place
for many years in the affections of New Yorkers.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>By far the most noteworthy operatic event of the
sixties was a season of German opera given by Carl
Anschütz at the old Wallack Theatre on Broadway and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>Broome Street in 1862. The principals of the Anschütz
company were mediocre, though they included Mme.
Johannsen, but there was a good orchestra and a well-trained
chorus. The list of operas included Mozart's
<em>Die Zauberflöte</em>, <em>Don Juan</em>, and <em>Die Entführung aus
dem Serail</em>, Beethoven's <em>Fidelio</em>, Weber's <em>Freischütz</em>,
Auber's <em>Le Maçon</em>, and Flotow's <em>Martha</em> and <em>Stradella</em>.
Unfortunately, no social glamour was attached to the
enterprise, nor were the times especially propitious
to it, and it soon failed.</p>

<p>In the seventies there was a great vogue of the Offenbach
<em>opéra bouffe</em>, and such airy trifles as <em>La belle
Hélène</em> and <em>La grande duchesse</em> occupied the public
interest to the exclusion of more serious musical fare.
As is usually the case in America, the interest reached
the intensity of a mania and it was necessary that public
curiosity be satisfied by a sight of the composer himself.
Accordingly Offenbach came over in 1875. But
as soon as the people had satisfied their curiosity they
lost all interest in him and his tour was a complete
failure.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In 1876 Mlle. Teresa Tietjens came to America under
the management of Max Strakosch and appeared at
the Academy of Music with great success, especially in
<em>Norma</em> and <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em>. Two years later a short
season of opera was given at the Academy by a German
company headed by Mme. Pappenheim and
Charles Adams. It was far from successful, but during
its brief existence New Yorkers had an opportunity of
hearing Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em>, <em>Tannhäuser</em>, <em>Der fliegende
Holländer</em>, and <em>Rienzi</em>, Halévy's <em>La Juive</em>, and
Gounod's <em>Faust</em>.</p>

<p>In 1878 Max Strakosch, with a company that included
Clara Louise Kellogg and Annie Louise Cary, ignored
the Academy of Music and settled down at the Booth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>Theatre. There he gave a season of three weeks, presenting
<em>Aïda</em>, <em>La Traviata</em>, and <em>Il Trovatore</em>. The directors
of the Academy, in the meantime, turned to Colonel
James H. Mapleson, one of the most famous of
operatic <em>impresarios</em>, who, as manager of Her Majesty's
Theatre and of Drury Lane, London, had for some time
been engaged in a lively operatic war with Frederick
and Ernest Gye at Covent Garden. Mapleson was a
most astute manager and a devoted protagonist of the
'star' system. During his first season in 1878-79 he
brought over a brilliant company which included Minnie
Hauck, Etelka Gerster, and Italo Campanini, with
Luigi Arditi as conductor. His list of operas was less
impressive. The only novelty was Bizet's <em>Carmen</em>. On
the whole, the season was moderately successful and
Mapleson made a contract with the stockholders of the
Academy for the seasons of 1879-80, 1880-81, and 1881-82.
Nothing occurred in any of those seasons which
calls for special mention. They presented the same old
list of operas in the same old way. Italian opera in New
York was getting into a rut and was losing its hold on
the people. The Academy was becoming more and
more unsuited to the growing demands of New York
Society. Everything was, in fact, ripe for the inauguration
of a new epoch.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It must be confessed that the evolution of opera in
New York has been determined more by social than
by artistic factors, and a history of New York society
would be almost a necessary background for a complete
narrative of its operatic development. Here it
is necessary to mention that the Vanderbilt ball of
1882 marked the culmination of a social revolution
in New York. During the early years of the nineteenth
century there was an absolute ascendancy of that social<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
element which is known by the name of Knickerbocker.
It was composed, in the main, of old families
with certain undeniable claims to birth, breeding, and
culture. They constituted a caste which was not without
distinction. But about 1840, with the rapid material
development of the country, began the influx of a
new element armed for assault on the social citadel
with the powerful artillery of wealth. Gradually this
new element widened a breach in the rampart of exclusiveness
which the Knickerbocker caste had built
around itself, and at the above-mentioned Vanderbilt
ball the citadel finally surrendered. The effect on the
operatic situation was immediate. There was not sufficient
accommodation in the Academy for the newly
amalgamated forces, and a box at the opera was, of
course, a necessary badge of social distinction. Consequently,
in 1883, the Metropolitan Opera House Company
(Limited) was formed by a number of very prominent
gentlemen for a purpose sufficiently indicated by
its title. The very prominent gentlemen were James
A. Roosevelt, George Henry Warren, Luther Kountze,
George Griswold Haven, William K. Vanderbilt, William
H. Tillinghast, Adrian Iselin, Robert Goelet, Joseph
W. Drexel, Edward Cooper, Henry G. Marquard,
George N. Curtis, and Levi P. Morton. This, financially
speaking, impressive list is important because it helps
us to understand the true nature of the enterprise upon
which these gentlemen embarked.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The Metropolitan Opera House was leased for the
season of 1883 to Mr. Henry E. Abbey and was opened
on October 22 with Gounod's <em>Faust</em>. In the cast on
the opening night were Mesdames Nilsson and Scalchi
and Signor Campanini, while Signor Vianesi acted as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>musical director. The season lasted until December
22, with regular subscription performances on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday evenings and Saturday
afternoons. Two performances missed from the regular
subscription series were given after the return of
the company from a trip to Boston on January 9 and
11. A spring season, begun on March 10, lasted until
April 12. The operas given between October 22 and
April 12, with order of their production, were: Gounod's
<em>Faust</em> (in Italian), Donizetti's <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>,
Verdi's <em>Il Trovatore</em>, Bellini's <em>I Puritani</em>, Thomas's
<em>Mignon</em>, Verdi's <em>La Traviata</em>, Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em>
(in Italian), Bellini's <em>La Sonnambula</em>, Verdi's
<em>Rigoletto</em>, Meyerbeer's <em>Robert le Diable</em> (in Italian),
Rossini's <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, Mozart's <em>Don Giovanni</em>,
Boïto's <em>Mefistofele</em>, Ponchielli's <em>La Gioconda</em>,
Bizet's <em>Carmen</em>, Thomas's 'Hamlet,' Flotow's 'Martha,'
and Meyerbeer's <em>Les Huguenots</em> and <em>Le Prophète</em>.
Apart from Mme. Nilsson and Signor Campanini, the
principal artists engaged were Marcella Sembrich—probably
the greatest coloratura soprano since Patti—who
afterward became very familiar to New Yorkers;
Mme. Fursch-Madi, a French contralto, who had already
sung in New Orleans; and M. Capoul, French
tenor, who had appeared at the Academy under Maurice
Strakosch in 1871. The company gave fifty-eight
performances in Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago,
Cincinnati, St. Louis, Washington, and Baltimore.
Mr. Abbey's losses on the season have been
estimated at more than $500,000. He had no ambition
to undertake another one.</p>

<p>Colonel Mapleson, in the meantime, was holding on
at the Academy, where he still retained Patti as the
chief attraction, assisted by the fresh-voiced Etelka
Gerster, then on the threshold of her career, Mme. Pappenheim,
whom we have already met in German opera,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
Signor Nicolini,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> a mediocre tenor, and Signor Galassi,
a good baritone.</p>

<p>During this season, also, there occurred under his
management the American operatic début of Mrs. Norton-Gower,
afterward known as Mme. Nordica. The
operas performed were Bellini's <em>La Sonnambula</em> and
<em>Norma</em>, Rossini's <em>La Gazza ladra</em>, Donizetti's <em>L'Elisir
d'amore</em> and <em>Linda di Chamouni</em>, the Ricci brothers'
<em>Crispino e la Comare</em>, Gounod's <em>Faust</em>, Flotow's <em>Martha</em>,
Meyerbeer's <em>Les Huguenots</em>, and Verdi's <em>La Traviata</em>,
<em>Rigoletto</em> and <em>Aïda</em>.</p>

<p>In 1884 Leopold Damrosch submitted to the directors
of the Metropolitan a proposition for a season of
German opera under his management, and, <em>faute de
mieux</em>, the directors acceded. Dr. Damrosch secured a
very strong company, including Amalia Materna, who,
in Bayreuth, had created the part of Kundry in <em>Parsifal</em>;
Marianne Brandt, also known in Bayreuth; Marie
Schroeder-Hanfstängel of the Frankfort Opera, a pupil
of Mme Viardot-García and the chief coloratura singer
of the company; Auguste Seidl-Krauss, wife of Anton
Seidl, then conductor of the Stadt Theater in Bremen,
and Anton Schott, a tenor of considerable reputation
in Wagnerian rôles, whose explosive methods led von
Bülow to describe him as a <em>Militärtenor</em>—<em>ein Artillerist</em>.
The list of operas given included Wagner's <em>Tannhäuser</em>,
Beethoven's <em>Fidelio</em>, Meyerbeer's <em>Les Huguenots</em>, Weber's
<em>Der Freischütz</em>, Rossini's 'William Tell,' Wagner's
<em>Lohengrin</em>, Mozart's <em>Don Giovanni</em>, Meyerbeer's <em>Le
Prophète</em>, Auber's <em>La Muette de Portici</em>, Verdi's <em>Rigoletto</em>,
Halévy's <em>La Juive</em>, and Wagner's <em>Die Walküre</em>.
It is not surprising that the season was a pronounced
success. The receipts up to the middle of January were
double those of the corresponding period in the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
year, though the prices had been reduced considerably.
But the season was brought to a tragic close and
the cause of German opera in New York was set back
many years by the unexpected death of Dr. Damrosch
on February 15, 1885.</p>

<p>During the previous year a season of Italian opera
had been given at the Star Theatre by James Barton
Key and Horace McVicker with the Milan Grand Opera
Company, recruited from Italian singers who had been
stranded by the failure of operatic ventures in Mexico
and South America. The only interesting feature of
the season was the production of <em>Il Guarany</em>, a Spanish-American
opera by Señor Gomez. Colonel Mapleson
started his seventh season at the Academy on November
10, 1884. He still retained Patti and had annexed
Scalchi and Fursch-Madi from Abbey's disbanded
forces, but his season presented nothing of interest
while it gave every evidence that his operatic reign in
New York was drawing to a close. The season of 1885-86
was his last with the exception of a short attempt
in 1896. He had lost Patti but he still presented a
strong company, which included Alma Fohström, Minnie
Hauck, and Mlle. Felia Litvinoff, better known as
Madame Litvinne. The season ended in a dismal failure
after twelve evening and four afternoon performances.
With the exception of <em>Carmen</em>, <em>Fra Diavolo</em>,
and <em>L'Africaine</em> there was no variation from the stereotyped
program of which New York must have been intensely
sick. During a short return engagement, however,
Mapleson's company gave Massenet's <em>Manon</em> for
the first time in America (Dec. 23, 1885).</p>

<p>A very much better showing was made by the German
company, which gave a season during the same
time at the Thalia Theatre under the management of
Gustav Amberg and the conductorship of John Lund, a
chorus master and assistant conductor under Dr. Damrosch
at the Metropolitan. The repertory included<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
<em>Der Freischütz</em>, Adam's <em>Le Postilion de Lonjumeau</em>,
Nicolai's <em>Die lustigen Weiber von Windsor</em>, Victor
Nessler's <em>Trompeter von Säkkingen</em>, and Maillart's <em>Les
Dragons de Villars</em> Germanized as <em>Das Glöckchen des
Eremiten</em>. A light program, of course, but very refreshing.
During the same season an American opera company
made a loud attempt to do something, but it blew
up with a bad odor of scandal before it went very far.
Its artistic director was Theodore Thomas, and during
its short existence it gave Goetz's 'Taming of the Shrew,'
Gluck's <em>Orpheus</em>, Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em>, Mozart's 'Magic
Flute,' Nicolai's 'Merry Wives of Windsor,' Delibes'
'Lakmé',' Wagner's 'Flying Dutchman,' and Massé's
'Marriage of Jeanette'; Delibes' ballet 'Sylvia' was also
performed. Considering this fine start, it is a very
great pity the American Opera Company could not
keep its head straight.</p>

<p>After the death of Dr. Damrosch the directors of
the Metropolitan sent Edmund C. Stanton and Walter
Damrosch to Europe to organize a company for a second
season of German opera. The result was perhaps
the finest operatic organization New York had yet seen.
It included Lilli Lehmann, the greatest of all Wagnerian
sopranos; Marianne Brandt, Emil Fischer, the inimitable
'Hans Sachs,' Auguste Seidl-Krauss, and Max
Alvary, who set the matinee-idol fashion in operatic
tenors. Anton Seidl was conductor and Walter Damrosch
assistant conductor. The operas produced were
Wagner's <em>Lohengrin</em>, <em>Die Walküre</em>, <em>Tannhäuser</em>, <em>Die
Meistersinger</em>, and <em>Rienzi</em>, Meyerbeer's <em>Der Prophet</em>,
Bizet's <em>Carmen</em>, Gounod's <em>Faust</em>, and Goldmark's <em>Die
Königin von Saba</em>.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1885 there was a short season at the
Academy of Music by the Angelo Grand Italian Opera
Company. Angelo was a graduate of the luggage department
of Mapleson's organization. His season
lasted two weeks, during which he presented Verdi's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
<em>Luisa Miller</em>, <em>I Lombardi</em>, <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>, and
<em>I due Foscari</em>, as well as Petrella's <em>Ione</em>. The American
Opera Company, in the meantime, had been reorganized
as the National Opera Company, which, still
under the directorship of Theodore Thomas, gave performances
in English at the Academy, the Metropolitan,
and in Brooklyn. Among the interesting features of
their program were Rubinstein's <em>Nero</em>, Goetz's <em>Der
Widerspenstigen Zähmung</em>, Delibes' <em>Lakmé</em>, and a number
of ballets, including Delibes' <em>Coppelia</em>. In the
spring of 1887 Madame Patti appeared at the Metropolitan
in a 'farewell' series of six operas under the management
of Henry E. Abbey. She continued to make
'farewell' appearances for over twenty years.</p>

<p>The most notable features of the Metropolitan season
of 1886-87 were the productions of Wagner's <em>Tristan
und Isolde</em>, Beethoven's <em>Fidelio</em>, Goldmark's <em>Merlin</em>,
and Brüll's <em>Das goldene Kreuz</em>. Notable, also, was the
appearance of Albert Niemann, histrionically the greatest
of all Tristans.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The season of 1887-88 saw the production
of Wagner's <em>Siegfried</em> and <em>Götterdämmerung</em>,
besides Nessler's <em>Der Trompeter von Säkkingen</em>, Weber's
Euryanthe, and Spontini's <em>Ferdinand Cortez</em>.
There were two consecutive representations of the entire
<em>Ring des Nibelungen</em> during the season of 1888-89,
the only novelty being <em>Das Rheingold</em>. <em>Der fliegende
Holländer</em>, <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>, <em>Norma</em>, and Cornelius's
<em>Der Barbier von Bagdad</em> were added to the
list in his season of 1889-90.</p>

<p>Outside the Metropolitan there was a season of German
opera at the Thalia Theatre in 1887, the prima
donna being Frau Herbert-Förster, the wife of Victor
Herbert. The list of operas offered was commonplace.
In 1888 the National Opera Company, without Theodore
Thomas but with a distinguished tenor in Barton
McGuckin, gave a short and unsuccessful season at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>Academy of Music. A notable event of the same year
was the first performance in America of Verdi's <em>Otello</em>
by a company brought from Italy by Italo Campanini.
The enterprise failed, partly owing to the incompetence
of the tenor, Marconi, who was cast for the title rôle,
and partly owing to the fact that New Yorkers, for
some peculiar reason, seem constitutionally incapable
of appreciating Verdi in his greatest and least conventional
works. Eva Tetrazzini, sister of the more famous
Luisa, was the Desdemona of the occasion.</p>

<p>The only performance of Italian opera in New York
during the season of 1888-89 was a benefit for Italo
Campanini at which he appeared with Clémentine de
Vère in <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>. During the season of
1889-90 some performances of opera in English were
given by the Emma Juch Opera Company at Oscar
Hammerstein's Harlem Opera House, which was also
the scene of a short postlude to the Metropolitan season
by a company conducted by Walter Damrosch and
including Lilli Lehmann. The Metropolitan in the
meantime was occupied by a very strong Italian company
under the management of Henry E. Abbey and
Maurice Grau. The company included Patti, Albani,
Nordica, and Tamagno,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> with Arditi and Romualdo
Sapio as conductors. Tamagno's presence meant, of
course, the production of <em>Otello</em>, and this was the only
interesting feature of the repertory. Patti was still
singing a 'farewell' in the old hurdy-gurdy list.</p>

<p>The season of 1890-91 proved to be the end of German
opera at the Metropolitan for some years. <em>Der
fliegende Holländer</em>, <em>Tannhäuser</em>, <em>Lohengrin</em>, the
<em>Ring</em> operas (except <em>Das Rheingold</em>), <em>Tristan und
Isolde</em>, and <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, Beethoven's <em>Fidelio</em>, Cornelius's
<em>Der Barbier von Bagdad</em>, Bizet's <em>Carmen</em>, and
Meyerbeer's <em>Le Prophète</em>, <em>Les Huguenots</em>, and <em>L'Africaine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></em>
were chosen from the regular repertory, while
the novelties were Alberto Franchetti's <em>Asraël</em>, Anton
Smareglia's <em>Der Vasall von Szigeth</em>, and <em>Diana von
Solange</em> by His Royal Highness Ernest II, duke of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The two first-named novelties
were of slight account, while the last-named was so
trivial as to lend color to the innuendos that the justly
famed liberality of His Royal Highness in the matter
of decorations was being exercised for the benefit of
some persons not unknown at the Metropolitan.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>For the season of 1891-92 the Metropolitan was leased
to Messrs. Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau. The lessees
brought together a brilliant company, including Lilli
Lehmann, Emma Eames, Marie Van Zandt, Giula and
Sophia Ravogli, Lillian Nordica, Emma Albani, Jean
and Édouard de Reszke, and Jean Lassalle. Vianesi
was conductor. Meyerbeer, Gounod, Bizet, Verdi, and
the older Italians supplied the list of operas for the season,
while <em>Lohengrin</em>, <em>Die Meistersinger</em>, <em>Der fliegende
Holländer</em>, and <em>Fidelio</em> were given (in Italian) as a sop
to the 'German element.' The only novelties were
Gluck's <em>Orfeo</em> and Mascagni's <em>Cavalleria rusticana</em>, the
latter having been given previously by two companies
in English. A supplementary season in 1892 featured
Patti in <em>Lucia</em> and <em>Il Barbiere</em>. In the same year the
Metropolitan was partially destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Opera House Company was reorganized
in 1893 as the Metropolitan Opera and Real
Estate Company and made a new lease with Abbey,
Schoeffel and Grau, which, through various vicissitudes,
lasted until Heinrich Conried took over the reins
in 1902. Abbey died in 1896 and Grau remained at
the head of affairs until Conried's advent. The season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of 1893-4 presented nothing new except Mascagni's
<em>L'Amico Fritz</em>, which did not make a sensation. There
was, however, a sensation in the fascinating shape of
Emma Calvé, whose <em>Carmen</em> is an imperishably piquant
memory with New York opera-goers. With Nellie
Melba and Pol Plançon she was the chief newcomer
of the season. A supplemental season presented Massenet's
<em>Werther</em>. Otherwise there is only to note the
<em>Carmen</em> craze provoked by Calvé and a <em>Faust</em> craze
induced by the coincidence of Emma Eames, Jean de
Reszke, and Plançon. The latter was so pronounced
as to lend point to Mr. W. J. Henderson's witty characterization
of the Metropolitan as the <em>Faustspielhaus</em>.</p>

<p>Calvé did not return for the season of 1894-5 and in
her place came Zélie de Lussan, whom New Yorkers
refused to accept as a suitable embodiment of Mérimée's
heroine. Francesco Tamagno and Victor Maurel
were the other noteworthy newcomers, while Luigi
Mancinelli was the principal conductor. The important
event of the season was the first performance of
Verdi's <em>Falstaff</em>, and there was a new opera, <em>Elaine</em>, by
the Argentine composer Herman Bemberg, a distinct
anti-climax.</p>

<p>In the meantime, there were signs that a new order
of things at the Metropolitan was much desired of a
large section of the New York music-loving public.
The Metropolitan had practically a monopoly of opera
in the city and a few serious attempts had recently
been made to break that monopoly. Oscar Hammerstein
and Rudolph Aronson had rushed to the front
with immature performances of <em>Cavalleria rusticana</em>
in 1891. The former, apparently, had already been
inoculated with the managerial virus and in 1893 he
opened his Manhattan Opera House on Broadway and
Thirty-fourth Street. Moszkowski's <em>Boabdil</em> and Beethoven's
<em>Fidelio</em> were the features of a season of two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
weeks which saw the beginning and end of that particular
enterprise. Some performances in English were
given at the Grand Opera House, beginning in May,
1893, and in the same year the Duff Opera Company
presented an English version of Gounod's <em>Philémon
et Baucis</em>.</p>

<p>There was, however, a demand of which these flimsy
ventures took no account, and the credit for realizing
it sufficiently to take chances on it goes to Walter Damrosch
and Anton Seidl. The former took advantage
of the presence in New York of Amalia Materna, Anton
Schott, Emil Fischer, and Conrad Behrens to give representations
of <em>Die Walküre</em> and <em>Götterdämmerung</em>
at the Carnegie Music Hall and the Metropolitan Opera
House, respectively. Further evidence of the strong
Wagnerian tendency in New York was the success of
an improvised performance of <em>Tannhäuser</em> by the German
Press Club. The next symptom of the movement
was the organization of a Wagner Society to support
a season of Wagner operas at the Metropolitan. Unfortunately
Seidl and Damrosch were rivals and could
not agree on a plan by which they might give German
opera together. Damrosch was able to secure subscriptions
enough to insure him against loss, and, after the
close of the Metropolitan season of 1894-95, he gave
seventeen performances of opera with a middling company
which included Johanna Gadski, then a novice,
Marie Brema, Max Alvary, and Emil Fischer. The enterprise
was devoted altogether to Wagner and was
an immense success. Denied the use of the Metropolitan
for another season, in 1896 Damrosch established
himself at the Academy of Music with a strong
company which numbered among its members Milka
Ternina, Katherina Klafsky, Johanna Gadski, Max Alvary,
and Emil Fischer. Besides the Wagner repertory
he presented <em>Fidelio</em>, <em>Der Freischütz</em>, and his own
opera, 'The Scarlet Letter,' based on Hawthorne's romance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of that name. The second Damrosch season was
a failure.</p>

<p>Before returning to the Metropolitan season of 1895-6
it may be mentioned that, on October 8, 1895, Sir Augustus
Harris, of Covent Garden, presented at Daly's Theatre
some 'beautiful music composed for the occasion'
by 'Mr. Humperdinckel.' Sir Augustus was referring
to Humperdinck's <em>Hänsel und Gretel</em>.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The Metropolitan
season of 1895-96 was distinguished by an announcement
that 'the management [had] decided to
add a number of celebrated German artists and to
present Wagner operas in the German language, all of
which operas will be given with superior singers, equal
to any who have ever been heard in the German language.'
The 'number of celebrated German artists,'
however, materialized into three, of whom only Marie
Brema could even by poetic license be characterized
as 'superior.' Calvé returned to glad the hearts of
<em>Carmen</em> lovers, and, except for the addition of Mario
Ancona, a sterling bass, the other principals remained
the same as in the preceding season. Anton Seidl was
conductor. Unquestionably the event of the season
was Jean de Reszke's presentation of Tristan in the
soft-toned vesture of <em>bel canto</em>. De Reszke, of course,
was too great an artist to turn the character into an
Italian stage lover, but he did present a vocally mellifluous
Tristan and his methods have influenced all
subsequent interpreters of the rôle. Two acts of Bizet's
<em>Pêcheur de Perles</em>, Massenet's <em>Navarraise</em> (with Calvé),
and Boïto's <em>Mefistofele</em> were other interesting features
of the season.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1896 Colonel Mapleson made a short
reappearance at the Academy of Music. He still retained
his bad taste in choosing a répertoire, but he
provided one novelty in the shape of Giordano's <em>Andrea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Chénier</em>. After the opening of the Metropolitan
season he moved to Boston, where his orchestra went
on strike and his American career ended forever. The
loss of Mme. Nordica by disagreement and of Mme.
Klafsky and Mr. Alvary by death was a handicap to
the Metropolitan in the beginning of its season of 1896-97.
Before the season had closed Melba injured her
voice singing Brünnhilde and had to retire; Eames was
compelled to undergo an operation, and Castelmary
fell stricken with heart disease during a performance
of <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. In spite of which the season
managed to run its allotted span. The only novelty
was Massenet's <em>Le Cid</em>.</p>

<p>There was no Metropolitan season in 1897-98, but
Walter Damrosch and Charles A. Ellis gave a series of
German and Italian operas at that house in January
and February, 1898, with an excellent company, which
included Melba, Nordica, Gadski, Marie Mattfeld, Emil
Fischer, David Bispham, and Giuseppe Campanari.
In May of the same year the Milan Royal Opera Company,
of La Scala, recruited chiefly from Mexico and
South America, introduced New York to Puccini's <em>La
Bohème</em>. The opera was again produced later in the
year at the Casino by another Italian company and in
English at the American Theatre by Henry W. Savage's
Castle Square Opera Company.</p>

<p>Melba and Sembrich came back to the Metropolitan
for the season of 1898-99 and among the newcomers
were Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Suzanne Adams,
Ernest Van Dyck, Albert Saleza, and Anton Van Rooy.
Nordica, Eames, Lehmann, Mantelli, the brothers de
Reszke, Pol Plançon, David Bispham, and Andreas
Dippel were also in the company—altogether a very
brilliant assemblage. The only novelty was Mancinelli's
<em>Ero e Leandro</em>. Antonio Scotti was a newcomer
in the season of 1899-1900, which was also distinguished
by a visit from Ernst von Schuch, director of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
opera at Dresden, who conducted two performances
of <em>Lohengrin</em>. Before the opening of the following season
the Metropolitan English Grand Opera Company,
promoted by Henry W. Savage and Maurice Grau,
gave a series of operas in English with a tolerably
good repertory and a very good list of singers. Savage's
Castle Square Company had already brought
forward earlier in the year a novelty in the shape of
Spinelli's <em>A basso Porto</em>, and at the Metropolitan he
produced for the first time Goring-Thomas's 'Esmeralda.'</p>

<p>For the season of 1900-01 Milka Ternina came to the
Metropolitan and New York was introduced to Louise
Homer, Lucienne Bréval, Fritzi Scheff, the inimitable
and much-lamented Charles Gilibert, Imbart de la
Tour, Robert Blass, and Marcel Journet. Mancinelli
was still conductor. The novelties were Puccini's <em>La
Tosca</em> and Ernest Reyer's <em>Salammbo</em>. Of the newcomers
for 1901-02 the only one that calls for mention
is Albert Reiss, whose Mime and David still delight
New York Wagner lovers. Isidore de Lara's <em>Messaline</em>
and Paderewski's <em>Manru</em> were the novelties, and there
was also a gala performance in honor of Prince Henry
of Prussia, which was one of the most elaborate displays
of snobbery ever staged in America. Walter
Damrosch, Signor Sepilli, and M. Flon were the conductors.
Alfred Hertz came over as conductor of German
opera for the season of 1902-03, and has remained
a distinctly reliable asset to the Metropolitan ever since.
The only novelty of that season was Ethel Smyth's <em>Der
Wald</em>, though Verdi's <em>Ernani</em> and <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>
had been strangers for so long that they were novelties
in effect. Before the opening of the season Mascagni
favored New York with a visit and produced at
the Metropolitan his own operas <em>Zanetto</em>, <em>Cavalleria
rusticana</em>, and <em>Iris</em>. His enterprise was not successful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Maurice Grau was compelled through ill health to
retire from the management of the Metropolitan during
the season of 1902-03 and before the opening of the
next season the reins passed to Heinrich Conried, a
native of Austria, who had already made an enviable
reputation as manager of the German theatre in Irving
Place and of various German and English comic opera
companies. Conried was an excellent impresario. For
his first season he annexed Enrico Caruso, Olive Fremstad,
and Otto Goritz, and brought over Felix Mottl as
conductor, besides retaining Sembrich, Eames, Calvé,
Homer, Scotti, Plançon, Journet, Campanari, and other
Grau stars. Everything else he did before or since,
however, was overshadowed by his production of <em>Parsifal</em>
on December 24, 1913. Whether his action was artistically
and ethically justified or whether, as many
believed, it was a violation of the sacred shrine of Bayreuth,
is not a question pertinent to this narrative. But
there is no doubt that his motives in staging the opera
were purely commercial and the manner in which he
advertised it was productive of unfortunate results
which cheapened Wagner's solemn art-work beyond
expression. For purposes of record it may be noted
that in this first American production of <em>Parsifal</em> Milka
Ternina was the Kundry, Alois Burgstaller the Parsifal,
Anton Van Rooy the Amfortas, Robert Blass the Gurnemanz,
Otto Goritz the Klingsor and Marcel Journet the
Titurel. Alfred Hertz conducted. Prompted by the
tremendous publicity given to <em>Parsifal</em>, Henry W. Savage
hawked it in an English version all over the country.
A much-touted novelty; a variant from the small-time
vaudeville, from the eternal stock company, from
eternal boredom; a cross between a church meeting and
a circus! Such was <em>Parsifal</em> to the shirt-sleeved communities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of America from coast to coast. It was a sad
spectacle—the saddest perhaps in the artistic annals
of this country.</p>

<p>In his second season Conried staged a rather too
elaborate production of Strauss's <em>Die Fledermaus</em>,
which he followed up in his third season with <em>Der
Zigeunerbaron</em>. The production of <em>Hänsel und Gretel</em>
in the presence of the composer and the revival of
Goldmark's <em>Königin von Saba</em> were creditable features
of the third season. In 1906-07 Mr. Conried outshone
himself and, whatever his motives, he stirred operatic
New York then as it had perhaps never been stirred.
To begin with, he produced Richard Strauss's setting
of Oscar Wilde's <em>Salome</em>. Such a fluttering in the
moral dovecotes has rarely been seen. Ever meticulously
careful of its spotless purity, New York protested
violently against the 'shocking exhibition' and, after the
first performance, the directors of the Metropolitan issued
the following notice: 'The directors of the Metropolitan
Opera and Real Estate Company consider that
the performance of <em>Salome</em> is objectionable and detrimental
to the best interests of the Metropolitan Opera
House. They therefore protest against any repetition
of this opera.'</p>

<p>However, the bad taste left by <em>Salome</em> in the mouths
of the Metropolitan Opera House patrons was presumably
removed by the gala productions of Puccini's
<em>Manon Lescaut</em> and <em>Madama Butterfly</em> in the presence
of the composer. The former had already been given
by an Italian company at Wallack's Theatre in 1898
and the latter in English by Savage's company at the
Garden Theatre in 1906. Other novelties of the season
were Berlioz's <em>La Damnation de Faust</em> and Giordano's
<em>Fedora</em>. In the season of 1907-8 the only novelty was
Francesco Cilea's <em>Adriana Lecouvreur</em>. The season
was otherwise notable for the presence of Gustav Mahler,
then conductor of the Court Opera, Vienna, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
gave extraordinary readings of <em>Don Giovanni</em>, <em>Fidelio</em>,
<em>Tristan und Isolde</em>, and <em>Die Walküre</em>.</p>

<p>Conried resigned from the Metropolitan management
in February, 1908. His managerial career was certainly
extraordinary; he thoroughly stirred New York's turgid
operatic waters. The list of artists introduced by him is
a brilliant one. Besides the names already mentioned
it includes Bella Alten, Lina Cavalieri, Geraldine Farrar,
Marie Mattfeld, Bessie Abbott, Marie Rappold,
Berta Morena, Carl Burrian, Allessandro Bonci, Riccardo
Martin, and the great Russian basso, Theodore
Chaliapine.</p>

<p>In the meantime Oscar Hammerstein, who had made
various immature attempts to break into the operatic
field, built a new Manhattan Opera House, which he
opened in December 3, 1906, for a season of opera
which closed on April 20, 1907. His high sounding
promises were not taken seriously by musical New
York, but the achievements of his first season changed
that attitude materially. True, the list of operas
brought forward is not inspiring. It included <em>I Puritani</em>,
<em>Rigoletto</em>, <em>Faust</em>, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, <em>Carmen</em>, <em>Aïda</em>,
<em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, <em>Il Trovatore</em>, <em>La Traviata</em>, <em>L'Elisir
d'amore</em>, <em>Gli Ugonotti</em> (<em>Les Huguenots</em>), <em>Il Barbiere
di Siviglia</em>, <em>La Sonnambula</em>, <em>Cavalleria rusticana</em>,
<em>Mignon</em>, <em>I Pagliacci</em>, <em>Dinorah</em>, <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>, <em>La
Bohème</em>, <em>Fra Diavolo</em>, <em>Marta</em>, and <em>La Navarraise</em>. But
the significant fact is that Mr. Hammerstein had the
courage to start a season of opera on an elaborate scale
in opposition to the Metropolitan and without the support
of 'society.' His success demonstrated the feasibility
of such an enterprise and gave an impetus to the
growth of public interest in opera, of which others are
now reaping the benefit. He was rather unfortunate
in his repertory, but he was more fortunate in his selection
of artists. Among them were Melba, Calvé, Regina
Pinkert, Bressler-Gianoli, Giannina Russ, Eleanora de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
Cisneros, Allessandro Bonci, Maurice Renaud, the
greatest of French baritones, Charles Dalmorès, Charles
Gilibert, Mario Ancona and Vittorio Arimondi. He
was additionally fortunate in securing Cleofonte Campanini
as conductor.</p>

<p>For his second season Mr. Hammerstein added to his
forces Lillian Nordica, Mary Garden, Emma Trentini,
Alice Zeppilli, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Jeanne Gerville-Réache,
Giovanni Zenatello, Amadeo Bassi, Mario
Sammarco, Hector Dufranne, Adamo Didur, and several
others of lesser note, besides retaining his principals
of the preceding season, with the exception of
Calvé and Bonci. Before the season closed he also
presented Luisa Tetrazzini. The first production in
America of Charpentier's <em>Louise</em> and Debussy's <em>Pelléas
et Mélisande</em> were notable results of a new policy which
was to make the Manhattan Opera House <em>par excellence</em>
the home of French opera in New York. Other
French operas on the list for the same season were
<em>Carmen</em>, Berlioz's <em>La Damnation de Faust</em>, Offenbach's
<em>Les Contes d'Hoffmann</em>, a revival, Gounod's <em>Faust</em>, and
Massenet's <em>Thaïs</em> and <em>La Navarraise</em>. The Italian list
departed from the hackneyed a little by the inclusion
of Giordano's <em>Siberia</em> and <em>Andrea Chénier</em> and of the
Ricci brothers' <em>Crispino e la Comare</em>.</p>

<p>After the resignation of Mr. Conried from the Metropolitan,
Giulio Gatti-Casazza and Andreas Dippel were
appointed managers. The former had been director of
La Scala in Milan, and the latter for several years had
been a prominent and versatile member of the Metropolitan
company. Apparently the design in conjoining
them was to give equal representation to the Italian and
German sides of the house. The results for the season
1908-9 were very pleasing and there was a good admixture
of Italian and German operas, without any startling
revolution in the general character of the repertory.
The novelties were d'Albert's <em>Tiefland</em>, Smetana's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
<em>Die Verkaufte Braut</em>, Catalini's <em>La Wally</em>, and Puccini's
<em>Le Villi</em>, while there were revivals of Massenet's <em>Manon</em>,
Mozart's <em>Nozze di Figaro</em>, and Verdi's <em>Falstaff</em>. The
most notable addition to the Metropolitan forces was
Arturo Toscanini, who came from La Scala as conductor
of Italian opera. Hertz and Mahler remained
as conductors of German opera, though Toscanini led
performances of <em>Götterdämmerung</em> and <em>Tristan und
Isolde</em> with apparent gusto and brilliant success.
Among the new singers were Emmy Destinn, Frances
Alda, Bernice di Pasquali, Marion Flahaut, Pasquale
Amato, Adamo Didur, and Carl Jörn.</p>

<p>In the same season Mr. Hammerstein brought forward
a number of interesting novelties, including
Saint-Saëns's <em>Samson et Dalila</em>, Massenet's <em>Le Jongleur
de Notre Dame</em>, and the <em>Princesse d'Auberge</em> of
Jan Blockx. He also had the hardihood to produce
<em>Salome</em>, and its success seems to indicate that the
squeamishness of New York's moral stomach had, by
some strange process, entirely disappeared. Except
for <em>Otello</em> there was nothing else of particular interest
in his list. During the season of 1909-10 he produced
Strauss's <em>Electra</em> and Massenet's <em>Hérodiade</em>,
<em>Grisélidis</em>, and <em>Sappho</em>. In addition he made experiments
with <em>opéra comique</em>, presenting Maillart's <em>Les
Dragons de Villars</em>, Planquette's <em>Les Cloches de Corneville</em>,
Audran's <em>La Mascotte</em>, Donizetti's <em>La Fille du
Régiment</em>, and Lecocq's <em>La Fille de Madame Angot</em>.
The most notable acquisitions to his forces in this season
were Madame Mazarin, a French dramatic soprano
of fine talent, Lina Cavalieri, and John McCormack,
the Irish lyric tenor. He no longer had the services of
Campanini, his principal conductor being the Belgian
de la Fuente. After the close of the season he sold out
to the Metropolitan interests and entered into an agreement
with them not to give grand opera in New York
city for ten years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>The season of 1909-10 at the Metropolitan had a number
of unusual features. The most prominent of them
was the appearance of a Russian troupe of dancers
headed by Anna Pavlova and Mikail Mordkin. Another
departure was a series of performances at the
New Theatre, a beautiful house originally designed to
give drama under somewhat the same auspices as prevailed
at the Metropolitan. The operas given at the
New Theatre were, on the whole, works of a light and
intimate character, such as <em>Fra Diavolo</em>, <em>La Fille de
Madame Angot</em>, Flotow's <em>Stradella</em>, Lortzing's <em>Czar und
Zimmermann</em> and Pergolesi's[?] <em>Il Maestro di Capella</em>.
Nineteen operas, three ballets, and a pantomime were
presented at this house. At the Metropolitan thirty-seven
were produced, the chief novelties being Franchetti's
<em>Germania</em>, Tschaikowsky's <em>Pique Dame</em>, Frederick
S. Converse's 'Pipe of Desire' (the first production
of an American opera at the Metropolitan), and Bruneau's
<em>L'Attaque du Moulin</em>. There was a splendid revival
of Gluck's <em>Orfeo ed Eurydice</em> under Toscanini.</p>

<p>After the close of the season Mr. Dippel left the
Metropolitan to assume the direction of the Chicago-Philadelphia
Opera Company, which was formed
chiefly of artists from Mr. Hammerstein's disbanded
forces. During the season of 1910-11 he gave a subscription
series of French operas at the Metropolitan
on Tuesday evenings from January to April. The
novelties of the series were Victor Herbert's <em>Natoma</em>,
Wolff-Ferrari's <em>Il Segreto di Susanna</em>, and Jean Nougues'
<em>Quo Vadis?</em> The regular Metropolitan season saw
the first production on any stage of Puccini's <em>La Fanciulla
del West</em> and Humperdinck's <em>Königskinder</em>, in the
presence of their respective composers. Dukas' <em>Ariane
et Barbe-Bleue</em> had its American première and there
was also a brilliant revival of Gluck's <em>Armide</em>.</p>

<p>The seasons of 1911-12, 1912-13, and 1913-14 at the
Metropolitan have been notable chiefly for the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
performance in America of Horatio W. Parker's
'Mona,' which was awarded the prize offered by the
Metropolitan directors for the best opera by an American
composer. Thuille's <em>Lobetanz</em>, Wolff-Ferrari's <em>Le
Donne Curiose</em>, Leo Blech's <em>Versiegelt</em>, Walter Damrosch's
<em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, Victor Herbert's <em>Madeleine</em>,
Moussorgsky's <em>Boris Godounoff</em>, Strauss's <em>Rosenkavalier</em>,
Charpentier's <em>Julien</em>, Montemezzi's <em>L'Amore
dei tre re</em>, and Wolf-Ferrari's <em>L'Amore medico</em> were the
other novelties. Among the new singers engaged for
those seasons were Lydia Lipkowska, Frieda Hempel,
Margarete Ober, Lucrezia Bori, Margarete Matzenauer,
Hermann Jadlowker, Leo Slezak, Carl Burrian, Jacques
Urlus, Hermann Weil, Heinrich Hensel, and Giovanni
Martinelli. During 1914-15 Melanie Kurt, Wagnerian
soprano, and Elisabeth Schumann were added to the
list of singers, and the novelties were Giordano's
<em>Madame Sans-Gêne</em> and Leoni's <em>L'Oracolo</em>. The season's
sensation was a revival of <em>Carmen</em> with Farrar.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In 1913 a project was launched through the initiative
of the City Club of New York to establish a regular
stock opera company which would provide good opera
at popular prices. The project was supported by the
Metropolitan directors—especially by Otto H. Kahn,
chairman of the board—and a guarantee was secured
sufficient to cover any deficit which the company might
suffer in the beginning. As there was considerable
doubt whether New York would support opera in English
it was decided to make the experiment of giving
operas in their original language and in English on
different nights. Messrs. Milton and Sargent Aborn
were entrusted with the management of the new enterprise
and they were assisted materially by the coöperation
of the Metropolitan in the matter of scenery and
other accessories. The company was selected on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
principle of securing a good, well-balanced ensemble
and avoiding any approach to the 'star' system.</p>

<p>Rarely has an operatic enterprise been launched
under more favorable auspices. It had the enthusiastic
and unanimous endorsement of the press, the lively interest
of the public, the backing of many of the wealthiest
and most influential men in New York, as well as
the quasi-official support of the city itself through the
City Club. Finally, it was installed in the beautiful
Century (formerly New) Theatre. Naturally, its first
season was to a large extent an experiment and there
was every reason to suppose that the faults disclosed
would quickly be remedied. But the Century enterprise
quickly succeeded in proving two very important
facts, viz., that there is in New York a large public
eager for good opera at popular prices and that this
public wants opera in the English language.</p>

<p>The season was not far advanced before it became
apparent that what we may call the Opera-in-English
nights were more extensively patronized than the performances
of operas in their original language, and the
management accordingly reduced the performances in
a foreign language to one a week. The success of the
enterprise was sufficiently indicated by the public demand
which was so unexpectedly great—especially for
the cheaper seats—that after the close of the season
the capacity of the house had to be increased to 1,800
seats.</p>

<p>The répertoire of the Century Opera Company during
its first season included <em>Aïda</em>, <em>La Gioconda</em>, 'Tales of
Hoffmann,' <em>Il Trovatore</em>, <em>Thaïs</em>, <em>Louise</em>, <em>Faust</em>, <em>La Tosca</em>,
<em>Lucia</em>, 'Samson and Delilah,' 'Madam Butterfly,' 'The
Bohemian Girl,' 'Romeo and Juliet,' <em>Rigoletto</em>, 'Haensel
and Gretel,' <em>Cavalleria rusticana</em>, <em>Pagliacci</em>, <em>Manon</em>,
<em>Lohengrin</em>, 'The Secret of Suzanne,' 'The Jewels of the
Madonna,' <em>Tiefland</em>, 'Martha,' and 'Natoma.' The conductors
were Alfred Szendrei and Carlo Nicosia. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
its season of 1914-15 the Century considerably strengthened
its forces, and particularly the orchestra, and
it added a number of experienced singers to its roll.
Most of its artists, it may be remarked, were Americans.
The new conductors were Agide Jacchia, late of
the Montreal Opera Company, and Ernst Knoch, who
was formerly assistant to Richter, Bolling and others
at Bayreuth. Jacques Coini, probably the most artistic
stage director New York has had in connection with
opera, was engaged in that capacity by the Century
Company. The répertoire was largely that of the first
season with the addition of <em>La Bohème</em>, 'Carmen,' and
'William Tell.' Of the entire list, ten were chosen
by popular vote. Altogether the quality of the performances
was considerably improved, most of the
crudities of the first season being eliminated. But
financially the enterprise, like all preceding efforts in
the same direction, was not successful and the general
support did not warrant the continuance of Mr. Kahn's
subsidy, and consequently performances were suspended
in the spring of 1915. Some sort of revival of
the enterprise is devoutly to be hoped for.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>During the greater part of the nineteenth century
New York was unquestionably the metropolis of opera
in America, and to trace operatic performances outside
that city is a complicated and difficult undertaking.
Generally speaking, other cities obtained their opera by
grace of visiting companies from New York and, on
the whole, that grace was not abundant. Exception
must be made in the case of New Orleans and San
Francisco. The latter city never enjoyed what might
be called a permanent operatic institution such as was
familiar to New York from the days of da Ponte, but
it had the advantage of frequent visits from opera
troupes on their way to and from Mexico.</p>

<p>The first opera given in San Francisco, as far as we
can discover, was <em>Ernani</em>, which was produced by
George Lover in 1853. Later, attempts to establish
Italian opera there were made by Lanzoni and Lamperti.
In 1857 Signor and Signora Bianchi gave a season
with a very good company and in opposition to
another company brought together by Thomas Maguire.
Those were the days of flowing gold in California,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
when the raw yellow metal was thrown on the
stage in moments of enthusiastic appreciation. It cannot
be said that artistic conditions were ideal. Madame
Anna Bishop was in San Francisco in 1858-59, but she
seems to have taken part only in operatic concerts.
A Spanish opera company and a company known as
the Bianchi Troupe appeared at the old Metropolitan
Theatre in the early sixties, producing <em>Norma</em>, <em>La Sonnambula</em>,
<em>La Favorita</em>, <em>Belisario</em>, <em>Linda di Chamouni</em>,
<em>Ernani</em>, <em>Nabucco</em>, <em>Il Trovatore</em>, and other works of the
same type. <em>La Traviata</em> was produced at a benefit for
Signora Brambilla in 1866 and three years later Parepa
Rosa appeared in <em>Don Pasquale</em>. In 1870 there were
three opera companies playing San Francisco at about
the same time. Alice Oates' Popular Opera Bouffe Company
gave <em>La Périchole</em>, <em>Petit Duke</em>, <em>La Fille de Madame
Angot</em>, and <em>Giroflé-Girofla</em> with great success, while
similar works were presented by a French company
with Marie Aimée. At the Bijou Theatre Campobello's
troupe gave <em>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</em>, <em>La Favorita</em>, and
other compositions of the same school. In the same
year Theodor Wachtel, the famous coachman tenor,
appeared—presumably in <em>Le Postillon de Lonjumeau</em>—and
Mme. Mez Fabbri also gave a series of operas.</p>

<p>For several years following we can find no definite
information about opera in San Francisco beyond the
fact that Mme. Zeiss-Dennis, the famous contralto, made
operatic appearances during the early seventies. In
1876-77 Marie Rose, Annie Louise Cary, and Clara
Louise Kellogg gave English representations of <em>Carmen</em>
and <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>, and in 1878 the two last-named
appeared in a season of opera at the Baldwin Theatre.
At the same theatre earlier in the latter year Catherine
Lewis sang in <em>opéra bouffe</em> of the <em>Giroflé-Girofla</em> type.
The redoubtable Colonel Mapleson brought Her Majesty's
Opera Company to San Francisco in 1881, and in
the following year the Emma Juch Opera Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
gave a season at Baldwin's Theatre. Mme. Eugénie
Pappenheim, whom we have already met in New York,
appeared with the German and Italian Opera Company
in 1884, and in 1884-85 there was a season of light
opera at the Tivoli Theatre, among the operas produced
being 'Little Red Riding Hood,' <em>Boccaccio</em>, and
'H. M. S. Pinafore.' The appearances of Etelka Gerster,
Adelina Patti, and Emma Abbott were other features
of operatic life in San Francisco in 1884.</p>

<p>From this time on San Francisco enjoyed opera in
large quantity and of occasionally high quality. Light
opera was especially in evidence, with the Tivoli Theatre
as its favorite home. Offenbach's 'The Georgians,'
as well as <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, 'Martha,' 'Cinderella,'
'The Mikado,' 'Nanon,' 'Nell Gwynne,' 'Olivette,' 'The
Three Guardsmen,' and 'Princess Ida' were produced in
1885. In the same year Amalia Materna, Emma Nevada,
and Sofia Scalchi made their San Francisco
débuts. The ill-fated National Opera Company and
Emma Abbott's troupe were the chief purveyors of
opera in 1887. The latter remained for a few years.
In 1889 came Paston and Canteli's Madrid Spanish
Opera Company, which produced <em>Il grand Mogul</em>, <em>La
Mascota</em>, <em>Galatea</em>, <em>Il Ballo in Maschera</em>, <em>Il Trovatore</em>,
and <em>La Zaroule</em>. Tamagno in <em>Otello</em> was the most noteworthy
event of 1890, and 1891 is remarkable for the appearance
of a Jewish opera troupe which gave operas in
the Jewish language. There is nothing particular to
record for the years 1892, 1893, 1894, and 1895. The
presence of the Tavery Opera Company was the chief
event of 1896, while in 1897 the predominant feature
was the appearance of Puccini's Opera Company in <em>La
Bohème</em>, <em>La Traviata</em>, <em>Cavalleria rusticana</em>, <em>Faust</em>, and
other works.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of opera in San Francisco is
chiefly the recital of visits by opera troupes from various
quarters. Apart from the Emma Abbott Opera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Company, which was more or less a fixture, there has
been no permanent operatic organization there; but
San Francisco is an eager supporter of opera and has
never lacked a generous supply of it. Comic opera has
been especially well supported and the Tivoli Theatre
has perhaps seen more of that form of entertainment
than any other house in the United States.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In New Orleans during the first half of the nineteenth
century opera flourished with a brilliance unknown
elsewhere in America. The Louisiana city was, as we
have pointed out, an American Paris, and the best operatic
artists of the French capital appeared there in
works selected from the current Parisian répertoire.
The opera house was the centre of social, artistic, and
musical New Orleans. It was an institution with a
tradition and an atmosphere. The brilliant and cultured
Creole society lent to it the glamour which only
society can give, but it was not dependent upon social
support in the same sense as the successive New York
opera houses were dependent on such support. It was
a popular institution; it was an integral part of the
life of the city; it was a source at once of pride and
pleasure to the humblest citizen. And to a certain extent
it remains so still.</p>

<p>The father of opera in New Orleans, as we have already
pointed out, was John Davis, who built the Théâtre
d'Orléans in 1816. This theatre was remodeled in
1845 and was destroyed by fire in 1866. Its glory, however,
had departed several years previous to the latter
date and had passed over to the New French Opera
House, erected by the New Orleans Opera-House Association
in 1859. The moving spirit in the new enterprise
was M. Boudousquie, who became its manager. M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
Parlange tried a season of opera at the Théâtre d'Orléans
in 1859-60, but without success, and the old house
then fell into disuse. Its history, however, had been a
brilliant one. For over forty years it had maintained a
standard of artistic excellence unsurpassed in America
and not far below that of the best European opera
houses. Its ensembles, both vocal and instrumental,
were exceptionally good—notably so, indeed, in a period
when operatic stars were too conspicuously in the
ascendant. True, its repertory was never remarkable
either for its novelty or for its eclecticism. But that
was a fault only too common to opera houses both here
and abroad during the first half of the nineteenth century.
The list of operas presented at the Théâtre
d'Orléans between 1825 and 1860 would be too long to
quote here, but it may be mentioned that during that
time New Orleans heard the following operas for the
first time: <em>Le Barbier de Séville</em>, <em>La Maette de Portici</em>,
<em>Fra Diavolo</em>, <em>Robert le Diable</em>, <em>L'Éclair</em> (Halévy),
<em>Sémiramide</em>, <em>Les Huguenots</em>, <em>La Sonnambula</em>, <em>Zanetta</em>
(Auber), <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, <em>La Esmeralda</em> (Prévost),
<em>Beatrice di Tenda</em>, <em>Il Furioso</em>, <em>L'Elisir d'Amore</em>,
<em>Norma</em>, <em>Guillaume Tell</em>, <em>La Favorita</em>, <em>La Fille du Régiment</em>,
<em>La Juive</em>, <em>Lucrecia Borgia</em>, <em>I Puritani</em> (in Italian),
<em>Belisario</em> (in Italian), <em>La Reine de Chypre</em>, <em>Der Freischütz</em>,
<em>Les Martyrs</em>, <em>Charles VI</em> (Halévy), <em>Jérusalem</em>
(Verdi), <em>Le Prophète</em>, <em>Le Caïd</em> (Thomas), <em>Les Deux
Foscari</em>, <em>Les Montenégrins</em> (Limmander), <em>La Gazza
Ladra</em>, <em>Tancredi</em>, <em>Othello</em> (Rossini), <em>Moses</em> (Rossini),
<em>Don Giovanni</em>, <em>Marguérite d'Anjou</em> (Meyerbeer), <em>La
Vestale</em> (Spontini), <em>L'Étoile du Nord</em>, <em>Il Trovatore</em>, <em>Ernani,
Jaguarita</em> (Halévy), <em>Martha</em> and <em>Rigoletto</em>. Of
these <em>Il Furioso</em>, <em>L'Elisir d'Amore</em>, <em>Les Martyrs</em> and <em>Le
Prophète</em> were given for the first time in America.</p>

<p>M. Boudousquie opened the New Orleans Opera
House with a brilliant company which included Mathieu
(tenor), Melchisedes (baritone), Genebrel (basso), and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
Feitlinger (soprano). He presented <em>Le Pardon de
Ploërmel</em> for the first time in New Orleans and put on a
number of operas already familiar to the city, including
<em>Rigoletto</em>, with the novice Patti in the rôle of Gilda.
The war naturally killed all operatic activities for the
time being. Subsequently the New Orleans Opera
House was reopened with a strolling company managed
by the Alhaiza brothers. In 1866 a splendid company
gathered together by the Alhaizas in France was
drowned on the voyage to America in the wreck of the
<em>Evening Star</em>. A surviving brother opened with an
Italian troupe, and since then the New Orleans Opera
House has continued its functions, with occasional interruptions,
<em>per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum</em>.
Italian, German and English companies have been
heard there from time to time, but on the whole it has
remained a thoroughly French house directed by
French managers and presenting opera in the French
tongue. Its principal artists have been selected from
among the best on the contemporary French stage and
have included many singers of world-wide reputation.
For years it has been the custom of the house to change
its singers every season, and on that account it would be
impossible to enumerate here the list of distinguished
artists who have appeared on its boards. Mention may
be made, however, of such well-known names as Devoyed,
Durnestre, Ambre, Tournie, Levelli, Pical,
Michat, Orlius, Etelka Gerster, Fursch-Madi, Paulin,
Baux, Mounier, Deo, Feodor, Albers and Maurice
Renaud. The following operas have been given in New
Orleans for the first time from 1866 to 1914, inclusive:
<em>Crispino e la Comare</em>, <em>Faust</em>, <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em>,
<em>Petrella's Ione</em>, <em>Linda di Chamouni</em>, <em>L'Africaine</em>, Gounod's
<em>Romeo et Juliette</em>, Donizetti's <em>Don Sebastian</em>, <em>Der
fliegende Holländer</em>, <em>Lohengrin</em> (in Italian), <em>Fidelio</em>
(in Italian), <em>Tannhäuser</em> (in Italian), <em>Aïda</em>, <em>Carmen</em>,
<em>Mefistofele</em> (in Italian), <em>Paul et Virginie</em>, <em>Mireille</em> (in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>

<p>Historically the French opera in New Orleans is of
great importance for its influence on the operatic development
of other cities. This is especially true of
Philadelphia, which was introduced to opera by the
New Orleans organization in 1827. Philadelphia, of
course, was already familiar with the English ballad
opera and it had heard a diluted English version of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
<em>Der Freischütz</em> in 1825, but of opera in its real sense
it was still quite innocent. The New Orleans company
which appeared at the Chestnut Street Theatre in 1827
returned each succeeding season until 1834. The following
list of operas produced by them may be of interest:
<em>Le petit Chaperon rouge</em>, <em>Joconde</em>, <em>Robin des
Bois</em> (<em>Der Freischütz</em>), <em>Azema</em>, <em>La Dame blanche</em>, <em>Le
Maçon</em>, <em>Werther</em>, <em>Thérèse</em>, <em>Rendezvous bourgeois</em>, <em>Le
Solitaire</em>, <em>La fète du village voisin</em>, <em>Adolphe et Clare</em>,
<em>Les voitures versées</em>, <em>Les Visitandines</em>, <em>Le nouveau
seigneur de village</em>, <em>Cendrillon</em>, <em>Les Folles amoureuses</em>,
<em>Aline</em>, <em>Moses in Egypt</em>, <em>La Vestale</em>, <em>Jean de Paris</em>, <em>Trente
ans de la vie d'un joueur</em>, <em>Fiorella</em>, <em>La Fiancée</em>, <em>Gulistan</em>,
<em>La Caravane de Cairo</em>, <em>La Dame du lac</em>, <em>Le Calife
de Bagdad</em>, <em>Comte Ory</em>, <em>La Muette de Portici</em>, <em>Fra Diavolo</em>,
<em>Guillaume Tell</em>, <em>Le Barbier de Séville</em>, <em>La Clochette</em>,
<em>La Gazza Ladra</em>, <em>Le Petit Matelot</em>, <em>La pie Voleuse</em>, <em>La
Jeune Prude</em>, <em>Zampa</em>, <em>Jean</em>, <em>Rossignol</em>, <em>Le Philtre</em>, <em>La
Tour de Nesle</em>. The Montressor Troupe, an Italian
company, appeared at the Chestnut Street Theatre in
1833 and gave Philadelphia its first taste of Italian
opera, presenting <em>Il Pirata</em>, <em>Italiani in Algieri</em>, <em>La Cenerentola</em>,
Rossini's <em>Otello</em>, and Mercadante's <em>Elisa e
Claudio</em>.</p>

<p>The proximity of New York insured frequent visits
of opera companies from that city, and it may be said
without exaggeration that from this time forward New
York was almost exclusively the source of supply for
opera in Philadelphia. So much is this so that to
follow the history of opera in the former city is practically
to follow it in the latter, except that New York
was a base and Philadelphia a visiting point. Opera in
English by the Woods was a feature of the Philadelphia
season in 1843 and, in the following year, the Rivafinoli
Opera Troupe, which we have already met in New
York, gave a season of ten nights. Cimarosa's <em>Matrimonio
segreto</em> was the most interesting of their offerings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
More opera in English by the Woods, the Seguins,
Caradori-Allan, Fanny Elssler, and others occupied
musical Philadelphia until 1845, the only break
being a short season in 1843 by an Italian company
which presented <em>Norma</em>, <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>, <em>Belisario</em>,
<em>I Puritani</em>, and <em>Gemma di Vergy</em>. The New Orleans
company reappeared in 1845 with <em>La Favorite</em>,
<em>La Fille du régiment</em>, <em>Robert le diable</em>, <em>Le Domino noir</em>,
<em>La Muette de Portici</em>, <em>L'Ambassadrice</em>, <em>La Juive</em>, and
<em>Les Huguenots</em>.</p>

<p>The Havana troupe, which we met in New York, regaled
Philadelphia in 1847 with Pacini's <em>Saffo</em>, Verdi's
<em>Ernani</em>, <em>I Lombardi</em> and <em>Due Foscari</em>, with Bettini's
<em>Romeo e Giuletta</em>, with <em>La Sonnambula</em>, <em>Mosé in Egitto</em>,
<em>Norma</em>, and <em>Linda di Chamouni</em>. The Seguins still
continued to give opera in English. Sanquirico and
Patti brought their company from New York in 1848,
without setting the Delaware on fire, though they included
<em>Don Giovanni</em> in their extended répertoire.
They remained in Philadelphia until 1851, when the
Havana troupe appeared with a splendid company, including
Bosio, Bertucca, Salvi, and Marini. The only
novelty produced by the Havana company was <em>Don
Pasquale</em>, but their performances were artistically the
finest that had been heard in Philadelphia. In 1852 the
Seguins produced Verdi's <em>Luisa Miller</em> for the first time
in America. Both Albani and Sontag appeared in Philadelphia
in 1853 with the old Rossini-Bellini-Donizetti
program, and a similar repertory secured the appearances
of Grisi and Mario in 1855. <em>Il Trovatore</em> was
heard in 1856 with Brignoli and Anna La Grange.
Opera in English still continued under various auspices.</p>

<p>An event in the operatic history of Philadelphia was
the opening in 1857 of the Academy of Music, which
continued to be the home of opera in that city until
Oscar Hammerstein built his Philadelphia Opera House
in 1908. It was erected by a company promoted and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
organized by most of the wealthy and socially prominent
residents of Philadelphia. The first year of its
existence was rendered interesting by the visit of a
German company headed by Mme. Johannsen, which
gave <em>Der Freischütz</em>, <em>Fidelio</em>, Auber's <em>Le Maçon</em>, and
Lortzing's <em>Czar und Zimmermann</em>. There was Italian
opera of the usual sort aplenty in that and the succeeding
year. The winsome Piccolomini made her
Philadelphia début in 1859 and additional variety was
introduced into the same year by the production of
<em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, <em>Don Giovanni</em>, Pergolesi's <em>La
Serva Padrona</em>, Meyerbeer's <em>Les Huguenots</em> and <em>Robert
le diable</em>, Verdi's <em>I Vespri Siciliani</em>, and Mozart's <em>Die
Zauberflöte</em>. Ronconi, Carl Formes (somewhat passé),
and Adelina Patti-Strakosch were the most notable artists—apart
from Piccolomini. A French company
gave Offenbach's <em>La Chatte Métamorphosée</em> and other
comic operas in 1860 and the following year saw the
first production in Philadelphia of Verdi's <em>Un Ballo in
Maschera</em> and Massé's <em>Les Noces de Jeanette</em>. Meyerbeer's
Dinorah was a novelty of 1862.</p>

<p>The German company with Madame Johannsen reappeared
in 1863 and 1864, and to musical Philadelphia
it must have come like the first breeze of autumn
after a parching summer. Its répertoire included
<em>Martha</em>, <em>Der Freischütz</em>, <em>Le Maçon</em>, Kreutzer's <em>Nachtlager
in Granada</em>, <em>Fidelio</em>, <em>Die Zauberflöte</em>, Lortzing's
<em>Der Wildschütz</em>, Boieldieu's <em>Jean de Paris</em>, Flotow's
<em>Stradella</em>, Mozart's <em>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</em>, and
<em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, Méhul's <em>Joseph</em>, Adam's <em>Le Postillon
de Lonjumeau</em>, Nicolai's <em>Die lustigen Weiber von
Windsor</em>, Spohr's <em>Jessonda</em>, Gounod's <em>Mireille</em>, as well
as <em>Don Giovanni</em>, <em>Faust</em>, and <em>Tannhäuser</em>. At least
seven of these were complete novelties to Philadelphia.
The Italians continued in force with Clara Louise Kellogg,
Bellini, Zucchi, and others. Petrella's <em>Ione</em> was
a novelty of 1863 and in 1864 'Notre Dame of Paris,'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
by the American composer W. H. Fry, was produced
under the leadership of Theodore Thomas. In 1865 <em>La
Forza del Destino</em> appeared and in 1866 <em>L'Africaine</em>,
<em>Crispino e la Comare</em>, and <em>L'Étoile du Nord</em>.</p>

<p>Balfe's 'The Rose of Castile,' Auber's <em>La Fiancée</em>,
Eichberg's 'Doctor of Alcantara,' Wallace's 'Maritana,'
and other works were given in English by
Ritching's troupe in 1866 and 1867. Indeed, opera
in English persisted in Philadelphia as it has done
nowhere else in America. Italian opera continued
on its usual course from year to year without any
achievements of special note. In 1868 and again
in 1873, 1875, and 1879 there was an epidemic
of <em>opéra comique</em> during which Philadelphia heard
<em>La Grande Duchesse</em>, <em>La Belle Hélène</em>, <em>Barbe-Bleue</em>,
<em>La Périchole</em>, <em>Orphée aux Enfers</em>, <em>Les Bavards</em>,
<em>Monsieur Chaufleuri</em>, <em>Géneviève de Brabant</em>, <em>L'Œil
Crève</em>, <em>Fleur de Thé</em>, <em>La Vie Parisienne</em>, <em>Le Petit Faust</em>,
<em>Les Cent Vierges</em>, <em>La Fille de Madame Angot</em>, and other
works of that type. The first performance of Gounod's
<em>Romeo et Juliette</em> in 1868, <em>Le Prophète</em> in 1869,
Bristow's 'Rip Van Winkle' in 1870, Thomas's <em>Mignon</em>
and <em>Hamlet</em> in 1872, Verdi's <em>Aïda</em> in 1873, <em>Lohengrin</em> in
1874, <em>Der fliegende Holländer</em> in 1877, <em>Rienzi</em> and <em>Carmen</em>
in 1878, and Boïto's <em>Mefistofele</em> in 1881 may also
be worthy of notice. During those years Strakosch and
Mapleson were the chief purveyors of opera to Philadelphia,
excepting, of course, the French troupes who
were so generous of <em>opéra comique</em> novelties. In 1882
the Boston Ideal Opera Company, of which we shall
have something to say later, appeared at the Walnut
Street Theatre presenting <em>Fatinitza</em>, 'The Pirates of Penzance,'
'The Mascot,' <em>Olivette</em>, 'Czar and Carpenter,'
'H. M. S. Pinafore,' and 'The Chimes of Normandy.'
The Emma Abbott Grand English Opera Company appeared
in the same year, as did Maurice Grau's French
Opera Company.</p>

<p>From this time on Philadelphia was supplied with
opera chiefly from the Metropolitan in New York until
Mr. Hammerstein built his Philadelphia Opera House
there in 1908 and presented the same attractions as
were heard at the Manhattan. After he sold out to
the Metropolitan interests the Chicago-Philadelphia
Opera Company, of which we shall speak later, catered
to the operatic demands of the Quaker city.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Chicago, in spite of—or perhaps because of—its phenomenally
rapid growth, has only recently become an
operatic city of any importance. But one must not conclude
that opera was unknown there before the unlucky
Mr. Hammerstein was compelled to forego the organization
which his genius had created and which formed
the nucleus of the Chicago Opera Company. Chicago,
indeed, became acquainted with opera while yet it was
a city only <em>in futuro</em>, and it continued to enjoy opera
with more or less regularity during all the succeeding
years, though it lacked a permanent organization of its
own until fate and Mr. Hammerstein conspired to supply
one.</p>

<p>The beginning of grand opera in Chicago has been
traced by Mr. Karleton Hackett, and his record of it
furnishes interesting and rather amusing reading.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Chicago in 1850 had a population of about 28,000 people
and a theatre built and managed by J. B. Rice. Mr.
Rice was enterprising and an important result of his
enterprise is noticed in the Chicago 'Journal' of July
27, 1850, as follows: 'Mr. Rice, ever ready to minister
to the tastes of the public, has effected an engagement
with an opera troupe of acknowledged reputation who
will make their first appearance on Monday evening.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>
<p>Among them are Mr. Manners and Miss Brienti, names
already familiar to many of our readers. This is a new
feat in theatrical entertainments and one which should
meet with distinguished favor.'</p>

<p>Two nights later <em>La Sonnambula</em> formally introduced
Chicago to the 'new feat in theatrical entertainments.'
As an example of musical criticism in its
simplest terms we quote the following from the 'Journal':
'An excellent house welcomed the Opera Troupe
to the Chicago boards last evening and <em>La Somnambula</em>
(!) was performed as announced. Whatever may be
the taste of the theatre-going public in this city with
regard to Operas, all must conceed (!) that the music
was of a high order, and executed with admirable grace
and skill. Miss Brienti's face is eloquent in her favor,
to begin with, and her voice, now as soft as a vesper
bell, now wild and shrill as a clarion, doubles and completes
the charm. Messrs. Manvers and Quibel both
possess voices of tone, power and cultivation, and with
Miss Brienti and Miss Mathews make melody and harmony
that Apollo would not hesitate to accompany
upon his ocean-tuned harp.'</p>

<p>The second performance of <em>La Sonnambula</em> was interrupted
by a fire which burned down Mr. Rice's theatre.
The enterprising manager, however, erected a 'new
and splendid establishment' which was opened early in
1851. Two years later Signor Poliani, 'acting in the
name and on behalf of Mme. de Vries and Signor L.
Arditi,' announced performances at the Chicago Theatre
of 'the opera in three acts, <em>Lucia di Lammermoor</em>,
the <em>chef d'œuvre</em> of Donizetti, and the grand masterpiece
of Bellini, <em>Norma</em>.' In addition to Mme. de Vries
and Signori Pezzolini, Toffanelli and Colletti, there was
'a very effective chorus of ladies and gentlemen—the
best in the United States of America and desirable even
in Europe.' The orchestra, furthermore, was 'composed
of solo performers, and all professors of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
highest standing—over 40 in number, the whole under
the magic direction of the most distinguished master
and composer, Sig. L. Arditi, of European fame and
well known as one of the greatest living composers.'
One is not surprised to learn that this marvellous company
made a great hit and remained in Chicago long
enough to give <em>La Sonnambula</em>. It was succeeded by a
troupe of 'acting monkeys, dogs, and goats.'</p>

<p>In 1858 Chicago had its next operatic treat when the
New Orleans English Opera Company—which assuredly
did not come from New Orleans—gave a season
of two weeks, presenting <em>La Sonnambula</em>, 'Daughter of
the Regiment,' Auber's 'Crown Diamonds,' and <em>Fra
Diavolo</em>, 'The Barber of Seville,' 'The Bohemian Girl,'
'Cinderella,' <em>Der Freischütz</em>, and <em>Il Trovatore</em>. The
tenor rôles were sung by a lady. In the same year Carl
Formes, whose reputation had outlived his voice, appeared
with a strong company which carried no less
than three conductors—the same being Carl Anschütz,
Carl Bergmann, and Theodore Thomas. Maurice Strakosch
with Amalia Patti, Brignoli, and the others of his
troupe visited Chicago in 1859, giving <em>Il Trovatore</em>,
<em>Martha</em>, <em>Norma</em>, <em>La Sonnambula</em>, <em>La Favorita</em>, and <em>Don
Giovanni</em>—the last-named with a 'cast which has never
been excelled in any opera house in Europe, New York,
Boston, or Philadelphia.'</p>

<p>From this time forward Chicago was supplied with
opera almost exclusively from New York and was included
in the itinerary of the tour with which nearly
every New York company began or finished its season.
The visits of the New York companies to Chicago
varied in length from a week to four weeks. After Mr.
Hammerstein sold out to the Metropolitan interests his
forces formed the nucleus of a newly organized Chicago-Philadelphia
Opera Company, which, under the
management of Mr. Andreas Dippel and subsequently
of Mr. Cleofonte Campanini, has since given Chicago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
regular seasons of opera rivalling in the standard of
their achievement those given at the Metropolitan in
New York.</p>

<p>The Chicago-Philadelphia company has divided its
season between the two cities after which it is named,
besides making post-season trips to a number of Western
cities. During the few years of its existence it has
placed to its credit a number of notable achievements,
including the first performances in America of Jean
Nougues' <em>Quo Vadis</em>?; Ermano Wolf-Ferrari's <em>Il Segreto
di Susanna</em> and <em>Le Giojie della Madonna</em>; Victor Herbert's
<em>Natoma</em>; Goldmark's 'Cricket on the Hearth' (in
English), Massenet's <em>Cendrillon</em> and <em>Don Quichotte</em>,
and Franchetti's <em>Cristoforo Colombo</em>. Its regular repertory
has been mainly that which prevailed at the Manhattan
Opera House under Hammerstein. The same
is true of most of its singers. Among the more notable
additions to its list of artists have been Jeanne Korolewicz,
Maggie Teyte, Caroline White, Lillian Grenville,
Mario Guardabassi and Tito Ruffo, and it has also
enjoyed frequent 'visits' from stars of the Metropolitan
and Boston Opera Houses, with both of which it is
closely affiliated.</p>

<p>Boston, like most other American cities, has been
until recently in the position of depending chiefly on
New York for its operatic fare. It was the latest of the
large Eastern cities to become acquainted with grand
opera, having been introduced to that form of entertainment
by the Havana company of Señor Marty y
Torrens in 1847. Satisfied apparently with what was
supplied to it from New York, it initiated no noteworthy
operatic enterprises of its own until 1909, when the
Boston Opera House was built through the munificence
of Mr. Eben D. Jordan. The artistic direction of the
new enterprise was placed in the hands of Mr. Henry
Russell, who for some years previously had toured
the country successfully with his San Carlo Opera Company.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Since then Boston has been an operatic city of
importance. In addition to excellent performances of
the regular French, Italian, and German repertory
made familiar by the Metropolitan and Manhattan companies,
it has heard the first performances in America
of Debussy's <em>L'Enfant Prodigue</em>, Raoul Laparra's <em>La
Habañera</em>, Frederick Converse's 'The Sacrifice,' Zan-donai's
<em>Conchita</em>, Erlanger's <em>Noël</em>, Kienzl's <em>Kuhreigen</em>,
Bizet's <em>Djamileh</em>, Louis Aubert's <em>Forêt Bleue</em>, and Henri
Fevrier's <em>Monna Vanna</em>.</p>

<p>The Boston Opera Company is very closely affiliated
with the Metropolitan and the principals of each are
carried on the roster of the other. To a lesser extent
there is a like exchange between the Boston and the
Chicago-Philadelphia companies. Almong the more
notable artists who have sung with the Boston company
(excluding those belonging principally to the Metropolitan
company) may be mentioned Carmen Mélis,
Georgette Le Blanc-Maeterlinck, Leon Sibiriakoff, José
Mardones, Florencio Constantino, Giovanni Zenatello,
George Baklanoff, Lucien Muratore, Vanni Marcoux,
and Eduardo Ferrari-Fontana.</p>

<p>It would be impossible, within the limits of a chapter,
to follow operatic activities in other cities of the United
States. Nearly every city of importance has received
more or less regular visits from the big New York companies,
from the Chicago-Philadelphia company, and
from lesser enterprises organized for touring purposes.
There would be little point in citing a list of these enterprises,
but mention may be made of the opera companies
promoted by Henry W. Savage and the Aborns,
which have done for the smaller cities of the United
States what the Carl Rosa and Moody-Manners companies
have done for the principal cities of Great Britain.</p>

<p>In many of the more progressive musical cities—such
as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Cincinnati—the
question of permanent operatic establishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
has been strongly mooted, and undoubtedly the
time is fast approaching when these and other cities
will enjoy the advantages which now belong only to
New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and New
Orleans.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The line of demarcation between grand opera and
comic opera is not easy to trace. Both have run together
with a promiscuity which makes it very difficult
to follow the history of one as distinguished from that
of the other. <em>Le Nozze di Figaro</em> and <em>Il Barbiere di
Siviglia</em> go hand in hand with <em>Fidelio</em> and <em>Norma</em>; <em>Die
Meistersinger</em> is a companion of <em>Tristan</em>. The convenient
tendency to spread the generic name of opera
over all forms of musico-dramatic expression is found
in all countries and periods. It is particularly noticeable
in America, where even the dignified Metropolitan
Opera House found it consistent to conjoin <em>Die
Fledermaus</em> and <em>Der Zigeunerbaron</em> with <em>Parsifal</em> and
<em>Salome</em>.</p>

<p>In our general survey of opera in America we have
touched on the comic opera activities which went on
more or less in association with grand opera, and it
only remains for us to refer briefly to the activities of
such companies as devoted themselves exclusively to
the lighter form of entertainment. The first of these,
of course, were the French companies from New Orleans
who familiarized the country with Pergolesi,
Rousseau, Piccini, Cimarosa, Méhul, Grétry, Dalayrac,
Boieldieu, Auber, and other masters of the light opera.
Apart from the companies playing English ballad opera—a
distinct <em>genre</em>—these were the only troupes of note
which presented exclusively the lighter side of operatic
art until late in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The real era of comic opera in America began about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
1870 and lasted for somewhat less than twenty years.
The first notable event of this period was the importation
of Miss Emily Soldene and company—then the
rage of London—by Messrs. Grau and Chizzola. They
opened a season of <em>opéra bouffe</em> in English at the
Lyceum Theatre, New York, in November, 1874, and
played to crowded houses for several months, presenting
<em>Généviève de Brabant</em>, <em>Chilperic</em>, <em>La Fille de
Madame Angot</em>, and <em>Madame l'Archiduc</em>. Afterward
they visited Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Boston—'beautiful,
bald-headed Boston,' as Miss Soldene called it—Washington,
Baltimore, Cincinnati, Chicago, Louisville, St.
Louis, Houston, Galveston, and New Orleans. In 1875
Madame Aimée arrived with her French <em>opéra bouffe</em>
company, also under the management of Messrs. Grau
and Chizzola, and soon afterward came the Offenbach
craze and the ill-starred visit of the composer.</p>

<p>Next came the vogue of the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas, with very fortunate results for America. The
manager of the Boston Theatre was then engaged in a
desperate and unsuccessful hunt for novelties and, in
the extremity of his need, he appealed to his musical
director. 'See here,' said the latter, 'this "Pinafore"
that everybody is crazy about has been already done
to death in many ways—but has it been really sung?
Never! Well, then, why not get Phillips and Whitney
and Barnabee and Tom Karl together and see what the
piece is like, musically.'<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The suggestion appealed to
the manager and it was agreed that the proposed cast
would be ideal. Hence the formation of the company
known as the Boston Ideals, which produced 'Pinafore'
on April 14, 1879. For all-round artistic excellence
nothing like that performance had ever been
given by an English-speaking company in America,
nor did any opera company ever make such a success
in this country as was achieved by the Boston Ideals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>
<p>Miss Soldene's troupe, it is true, was a tremendous
rage, but she is frank enough to confess that its success
was not exactly a triumph of pure art. Setting
a precedent for all managers of musical comedy, she
selected a chorus with a minimum of voice and a maximum
of personal pulchritude. She was rewarded by
liberal patronage from the sort of men who know the
difference between a chorus girl and a show girl. The
Boston Ideals, on the other hand, were a splendidly
talented and efficient organization, containing some of
the finest artists America had produced and inspired
with a sincere enthusiasm for their work. During the
six years following the production of 'Pinafore' they
played 'The Sorcerer,' <em>Boccaccio</em>, <em>Olivette</em>, 'The Mascot,'
'Czar and Carpenter,' 'Bohemian Girl,' 'Chimes of
Normandy,' 'The Musketeers,' 'Pirates of Penzance,'
'Patience,' 'Marriage of Figaro,' <em>Fra Diavolo</em>, 'The
Weathercock' (their only failure), <em>Giroflé-Girofla</em>,
<em>Barbe-Bleue</em>, 'Martha,' <em>Fanchonette</em>, <em>Giralda</em>, <em>L'Elisir
d'Amore</em>, and 'Visit of the Blue Stocking.'</p>

<p>Subsequently the company was reorganized and, at
the suggestion of Colonel Henry Watterson, was christened
'The Bostonians.' Under its new name the company
lived for twenty-five years, surviving by considerable
length the popularity of comic opera in America.
Among the works it produced were 'The Poachers,'
'Dorothy,' <em>Don Pasquale</em>, <em>Don Quixote</em>, <em>Mignon</em>, 'Pygmalion
and Galatea,' 'Robin Hood,' 'The Knickerbockers,'
'The Ogalallas,' 'Prince Ananias,' 'In Mexico, or a
War-time Wedding,' 'The Serenade,' 'Rip Van Winkle,'
'Maid Marian,' 'Rob Roy,' 'Vice Roy,' 'The Smugglers,'
'Maid of Plymouth,' and 'Queen of Laughter.' Of these
the most successful by far was De Koven's 'Robin
Hood,' which the Bostonians played for twelve years
without dimming the freshness of that most delightful
of American light operas. Not the least valuable of the
services rendered to music by the Bostonians was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
opportunity they gave to young American singers. 'The
Bostonians,' said Henry Clay Barnabee, 'gave the United
States the most successful school for operatic study that
this country has ever had, and from its ranks graduated
an astonishing number of well-known singers.
No other organization has done more, if as much,
toward assisting American writers of opera.' A list of
the well-known graduates of the Bostonians would be
too long to quote, but among the familiar names may
be mentioned Marie Stone, Alice Nielsen, Grace Van
Studdiford, Jessie Bartlett Davis, Marcia Van Dresser,
Kate Condon, Tom Karl, Joseph Sheehan, George B.
Frothingham, Eugene Cowles, Allan Hinckley, and W.
H. MacDonald, besides the inimitable comedian—Barnabee.
The company, of course, devoted its efforts
largely to Boston, New York, and other Eastern cities,
but it made frequent tours west of the Mississippi, playing
every city of importance between that river and the
Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>In New York the chief purveyor of comic opera during
the seventies was Maurice Grau, who had brought
over Emily Soldene and Mme. Aimée and who continued
to import European favorites, including the Offenbach
operetta queen, Madame Théo. Rudolph Aronson,
who had done some successful experimenting in concert
direction, next came forward with an original scheme
for a combined theatre, concert hall, restaurant, and
roof garden—an American adaptation of such European
institutions as the Ambassadeurs, Kroll's Garten,
and the Volksgarten. With the backing of nearly all
the socially and financially prominent gentlemen in
New York he formed the New York Casino Company
and built the Casino, a Mauresque structure which is as
much in place on Broadway as Independence Hall
would be in Algiers. With the operetta company of John
A. McCaull, taken over from the Bijou Opera House, the
Casino opened in October, 1882, presenting Johann<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Strauss's 'The Queen's Lace Handkerchief.' After a
very successful run this operetta was taken off to make
room for the Maurice Grau French Opera Company
headed by Madame Théo, which gave <em>La Jolie Parfumeuse</em>,
<em>Romeo et Juliette</em>, <em>Paul et Virginie</em>, <em>La Fille
de Madame Angot</em>, and <em>La Mascotte</em>. The McCaull Opera
Company, with Lillian Russell, then returned to the
Casino, presenting 'The Sorcerer,' 'The Princess of
Trebizond,' 'The Queen's Lace Handkerchief,' 'Prinz
Methusalem,' 'The Beggar Student,' 'Merry War,' 'Polly,'
'Billie Taylor,' 'Nanon,' 'Amorita,' 'Gypsy Baron,'
'Erminie,' 'The Marquis,' 'Madelon,' 'Nadjy,' 'The Yeomen
of the Guard,' 'The Brigands,' 'The Drum Major,'
'The Grand Duchess,' 'The Brazilian,' 'Madame Angot,'
'Poor Jonathan,' 'Apollo,' 'Indigo,' 'The Tyrolean,' <em>Cavalleria
rusticana</em>, 'Uncle Celestin,' 'Child of Fortune,'
'The Vice-Admiral,' and 'The Rainmaker of Syria.'
This company had become known in the meantime as
the Casino Comic Opera Company. In 1886 it went on
tour, playing Boston, Philadelphia, and Brooklyn, while
the Casino was occupied by the Violet Cameron Opera
Company from London. The latter presented 'The
Commodore' and 'Kenilworth' with little success. In
1892 Mr. Aronson decided to change the policy of the
Casino and to produce there lighter works of the best
French and German operatic schools. While he was in
Europe the directors of the Casino decided to turn the
house into a music hall on the style of the Empire and
the Alhambra in London.</p>

<p>By this time, however, comic opera had lost its hold
on the fickle affections of the American people and frequent
efforts to revive interest in it since then have met
with no more than the success of a temporary curiosity.
Much of the decline in the popularity of comic opera
was due to the rise of the English musical comedy, beginning
with 'Florodora' and 'The Belle of New York.'
Except for occasional excursions into Orientalism, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
'The Geisha' and 'San Toy,' musical comedy rapidly
ran into a set type of 'girl' show invariably characterized
by inanity of plot, mediocrity of text and music,
and a lavish display of feminine charms. For a
time the success of Lehàr's 'Merry Widow' induced a
vogue of Viennese light opera, of which traces still
exist, and occasional revivals <em>de luxe</em> of 'Erminie,'
'Robin Hood,' and the Gilbert and Sullivan operas
aroused temporary interest. But since the old Casino
days there has been no public in New York for comic
opera and in that respect the fashion of New York has
been followed by the rest of the country. No comic
opera which has come before the public on its own
merits and without the support of some such stimulus
as the 'Soul Kiss' waltzes of the new Viennese school,
has been able to win any measure of success. An instance
may be cited in the complete failure of 'Veronique.'
Attempts to reach a public educated above the
musical attractions of the ordinary theatres have been
no more fruitful. Oscar Hammerstein made a gallant
and costly effort with French comic opera at the Manhattan
and the Metropolitan followed his good example
more eclectically at the New Theatre (now the Century).
In neither case was New York interested. Even
when the indomitable and persevering Mr. Hammerstein
shifted to Broadway and to the vernacular, his
productions of 'Hans the Flute Player' and 'The Firefly,'
flavored with the <em>sauce piquante</em> of Emma Trentini,
failed to stimulate a lasting appetite in the New York
theatre-goers. Andreas Dippel opened a series of comic
opera productions in the season of 1914-15. How far
and how successfully his plans will mature remains to
be seen. But so far the lethargy of the public toward
comic opera has triumphantly resisted every attempt to
rouse it and the prospects of the enterprising impresario
in that field are far from encouraging. The trouble
seems to lie deeper than mere indifference to a particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
genre of musical entertainment. It is presumably
symptomatic of a general apathy toward good music,
or rather of a general lack of intelligent æsthetic appreciation.
That the faculty of intelligent æsthetic appreciation
is somewhat rudimentary in the average American
of to-day is a fact that the unbiased observer can
hardly escape.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>In spite of the work done by the Euterpean Society,
the Musical Fund and the Sacred Music Society, New
York in the first decades of the nineteenth century did
not possess an orchestral organization capable of interpreting
adequately the compositions of the great
masters. As we have already pointed out, the city
was suffering from musical expansion when it really
needed concentration. It was suffering also from too
much amateurism. Many clear-headed New York musicians
realized the needs of the situation and eventually
there arose a healthy agitation in favor of a strong
permanent orchestra of professional musicians. The
agitation found an energetic leader in Uriah C. Hill,
conductor of the Sacred Music Society, and chiefly
through his efforts the Philharmonic Society was
formed in 1842. In many respects the Philharmonic
differed from all the societies which preceded and most
of those which have followed it in America. It was
simply a coöperative association of professional musicians
organized for the purpose of giving concerts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
the highest class. Amateurs were excluded and the
society enjoyed neither patronage nor guarantee. Its
first concert took place at the old Apollo Rooms on
December 7, 1842, with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
as the <em>pièce de résistance</em>. The list of symphonies performed
by it during the first ten years of its existence
illustrates the consistence with which it carried out its
dignified purpose. Among them were Beethoven's
Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and
Ninth; Mozart's 'Jupiter,' G minor and E flat; Haydn's
Third and B flat; Mendelssohn's Third and Fourth;
Schubert's C major; Schumann's First; Spohr's D minor,
<em>Die Weihe der Töne</em> and Double Symphony;
Kalliwoda's First; Gade's in C; and Lachner's Prize
Symphony. Among the other interesting features of its
early seasons were Mendelssohn's 'Fingal's Cave,'
Sterndale Bennett's 'The Naiads,' and Berlioz's <em>Francs
Juges</em> overtures.</p>

<p>But the Philharmonic, in spite of its splendid efforts,
failed to win unanimous endorsement from musical
New York and in 1854 there was a revolt of several of its
own members, headed by G. Bristow and by Fry, musical
critic of the 'Tribune.' The grievance was that the
Philharmonic had made 'a systematic effort for the
extinction of American music.' Mr. Bristow was especially
wroth. During the eleven years of its existence,
he complained, the society had played only one
piece of American composition, preferring to devote
itself to the works of German masters, 'especially if
they be dead'—meaning Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,
Mendelssohn, Schubert, and others. By these and similar
remarks we may gauge the mental calibre of Mr.
Bristow. Whatever grain of justice may have been in
the movement which he headed, it could not possibly
succeed under his leadership and, after threatening for
a time the very existence of the Philharmonic, the
American revolution petered out. It was not the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
time, however, that the society suffered from the pernicious
activity of stupid and bigoted incompetents.</p>

<p>The orchestra of the Philharmonic during its first
season numbered fifty-three performers, divided as
follows: seventeen violins, five violas, four violoncellos,
five contrabasses, three flutes, one piccolo, two oboes,
two clarinets, three bassoons, four horns, two trumpets,
four trombones, and one pair of kettle drums. In the
beginning there was no permanent conductor, but at
different times between 1842 and 1849 the orchestra
was led by Uriah C. Hill, H. C. Timms, W. Alpers, G.
Loder, L. Wiegers, D. G. Etienne, and A. Boucher.
Theodore Eisfeld was conductor from 1849 to 1855 and
from the latter year until 1866 he alternated with Carl
Bergmann. From 1866 until 1876 Bergmann was sole
conductor and his services to music in New York during
those years were of the highest value. He was especially
instrumental in bringing before New Yorkers
the compositions of Liszt, Wagner, Raff, Rubinstein,
and the romanticists generally. Dr. Leopold Damrosch
conducted the orchestra in 1876-77, and then came
Theodore Thomas, who signalized his entrance by performing
the First Symphony of Brahms. Thomas
probably did more to cultivate the taste of New York
concert goers than any other orchestral conductor who
ever worked in that city. Bach, Beethoven, and
Brahms, over and over again, formed the burden of his
musical message, and for variety Tschaikowsky, Wagner,
Liszt, and Rubinstein. He was an idealist—an uncompromising
idealist—and, as he would not descend
to the concert-going public, the concert-going public
perforce ascended to him. His work was of incalculable
value. In 1891 he was succeeded by Anton Seidl, another
big figure and the best possible successor of
Thomas. Seidl was more tolerant than Thomas and
more modern in spirit. He laid less emphasis on the

And he was much more generous of novelties, which
included the first performance anywhere of Dvořák's
'New World' symphony. Admirably did he build on
the solid foundation his predecessor had laid. After
his death in 1898 Emil Paur succeeded to the bâton
and reigned until 1902, when Walter Damrosch conducted
for a season. Then for three years the society
presented a series of guest conductors, including Édouard
Colonne, Wassili Safonoff, Gustav Kogel, Henry
Wood, Victor Herbert, William Mengelberg, Max Fiedler,
Ernest Kunwald, Fritz Steinbach, Richard Strauss,
Felix Weingartner, and Karl Panger. Safonoff was
then engaged for three years and after him came Gustav
Mahler, one of the greatest and most individual
conductors of recent times. Mahler's interpretations
and technical innovations stirred musical New York to
its depths and aroused a storm of critical commentary
both favorable and otherwise. His sudden resignation
in 1911 was wrapped in a cloud of mystery, not free
from a black tinge of scandal, the onus of which, however,
did not rest upon him. He was succeeded by
Josef Stransky, who still remains (1915).</p>

<p>In 1912 the Philharmonic was the fortunate recipient
of a bequest of $500,000 from Joseph Pulitzer, late
owner and editor of the New York 'World.' Under the
conditions of this bequest the society was reorganized
from a coöperative association into a membership corporation.
The results in many ways have been advantageous.
While the coöperative idea had some
good features, it had the great drawback that in unprofitable
seasons the members sought more lucrative
engagements, with a consequent reduction of rehearsals
and loss of homogeneity in the work of the orchestra.
Under the new system a stricter discipline is possible
and in consequence the orchestra shows a great improvement
in technique.</p>

<p>The Philharmonic, of course, was never long without
a rival in New York. Brooklyn made the first
serious effort at competition when its own Philharmonic
was established in 1857 with Theodore Eisfeld as
conductor. During its initiatory season it produced
Beethoven's Third and Seventh Symphonies, Mendelssohn's
Fourth, and Gade's C Major. Carl Bergmann
succeeded Eisfeld and after him came Theodore
Thomas. The early history of the Brooklyn Philharmonic
was brilliant with achievement and promise, but
unfortunately that achievement was not sustained nor
that promise fulfilled. The indefatigable Theodore
Thomas maintained a lively rivalry with the New York
Philharmonic off and on between 1864 and 1879. He
gave annual series of what he called symphony <em>soirées</em>,
and for a few years he also gave garden concerts in
summer. In 1879 he went west as director of the newly
established Cincinnati College of Music, but two years
later he returned as conductor of the Philharmonic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dr. Leopold Damrosch in 1878 founded
the Symphony Society of New York with the avowed
purpose of breaking away from the established conservatism
of the Philharmonic and exploring newer
fields of musical composition. Dr. Damrosch conducted
the orchestra until his death in 1885, when he was succeeded
by his son Walter. At first the society gave only
twelve concerts yearly but its activities gradually increased
until it was giving about one hundred—its average
for the last ten years. These include extended
tours throughout the United States and Canada. The
career of the Symphony Society has not been without
vicissitudes. For many years after the death of Dr.
Damrosch it had to fight a discouraging struggle against
lack of interest and of financial backing. In 1899 Walter
Damrosch retired from the fight and devoted himself
to composition; but in the following year he went
to the Metropolitan as conductor of German opera, and
apparently the experience revived his ambitions as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
conductor. After he retired from the Metropolitan he
succeeded in obtaining a subsidy for the Symphony
Society from a number of prominent New York citizens.
Since then the fortunes of the organization have
been in the ascendant and they were definitely assured
in the spring of 1914 when its president, Mr. H. H.
Flagler, announced 'that in order to further its artistic
aims, he was prepared for the future to defray any
deficit of the society up to the amount of one hundred
thousand dollars annually.'</p>

<p>Though the prime purpose of the New York Symphony
is to produce important novelties, it has always
rested its program on the foundation of the classics.
Dr. Damrosch was a devoted lover of Beethoven, and
it was entirely in accordance with his ideals that the
society, in 1907, gave the first Beethoven festival in
America. Many of the symphonic works of Brahms,
Tschaikowsky, Sibelius, and Elgar were given their
first performances in America by the Symphony Society
and the first Brahms festival in this country was given
by it in 1912. As if to complete the society's identification
with the trio of immortal 'B's,' Mr. Damrosch has
shown lately a large devotion to the works of Bach.
Since 1907 the society has given much attention to the
modern French school and has introduced New York
to many compositions of Debussy, Dukas, Enesco,
Chausson, and Ravel.</p>

<p>The popularity of 'guest' conductors, due to the experiment
of the Philharmonic Society, led Mr. Damrosch
in 1905-06 to hand over the bâton for several
concerts to Felix Weingartner; but, as Mr. Henderson
says, Weingartner's 'refined scholarship and intellectual
subtlety escaped the notice of all save the connoisseurs'
and his engagement failed to arouse much
public interest. Except for this brief interim Mr.
Damrosch has been the society's only conductor since
1885. In addition to its regular activities the orchestra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
is employed to play the programs of the Young People's
Symphony Concerts given originally under the conductorship
of Frank Damrosch but latterly under that of
Walter. These concerts were planned as an educational
series for juveniles, but they have come to make
a much wider appeal and attract audiences which consist
more of adults than of children. Their educational
value is considerable.</p>

<p>Of even broader educational value, perhaps, is the
work of the People's Symphony Orchestra, conducted
by Franz X. Arens—though it is handicapped by lack
of sufficient endowment. The object of the orchestra
is to provide good music for working people of small
means, and it would seem that such an object is sufficiently
laudable to attract generous support from
those wealthy music-lovers who profess a sincere interest
in the promotion of the art. In spite of handicaps
the People's Symphony has existed since 1900, but insufficient
funds have spelled little rehearsal and few
concerts, with a consequent circumscribing of its
efforts.</p>

<p>When musical cultivation in any community reaches
a certain stage it tends to specialize. That stage has
long been passed in New York and during recent years
there has been a notable outcrop of societies devoted
to the study and performance of the compositions of
different nations, periods or schools. In the symphonic
field the most notable of these is the Russian Symphony
Society, founded in 1903. The orchestra, under the direction
of Modest Altschuler, is composed largely of
Russian musicians and is devoted almost exclusively
to the performance of works by Russian composers.
Since its foundation it has introduced New York to
new compositions by Tschaikowsky, Glinka, Napravnik,
Rimsky-Korsakoff, Glazounoff, Rubinstein, Ippolitoff-Ivanoff,
Davydoff, Gretchaninoff, Taneieff, Moussorgsky,
Arensky, Borodine, Kallinnikoff, Rachmaninoff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Dargomijsky, Afanasyeff, César Cui, Glière, Scriabine,
Balakireff, and others.</p>

<p>There remains to be mentioned the Volpe Symphony
Orchestra founded by Arnold Volpe in 1904, the Italian
Symphony Orchestra, formed in 1913 by Pietro Floridia,
and a number of temporary orchestras got together
for special purposes, such as park concerts.
For several years New York has maintained a high
standard in its open air free concerts in Central Park.
These have been so extensively patronized that it has
been found desirable to give as many as seven a week,
from June to September.</p>

<p>Until the last quarter of the nineteenth century Boston
lagged considerably behind New York in the matter
of orchestral music. After the demise of the Boston
Philharmonic Orchestra in 1824 the city was without
any permanent symphonic organization until 1840,
when the Academy of Music established an orchestra.
During its existence of seven years the Academy orchestra
varied in size from twenty-five to forty performers,
many of whom were amateurs. It introduced
to Boston most of the standard symphonies and some
other works of importance, but its ambition seems to
have been greater than its ability. It was succeeded
in 1847 by the Musical Fund Society, founded in imitation
of the Philadelphia society of that name, by
Thomas Comer. Comer leaned emphatically to the
popular in music and there was little value to the performances
of the Musical Fund until George J. Webb
took over the leadership during the last few years of
the society's life, which ended in 1855. In the meantime
Boston had been enjoying good music through
the agency of the Germania Orchestra, a body of young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
German musicians who had come to America during
the revolutionary troubles of 1848. The Germania was
a travelling orchestra, but it gave a large proportion
of its concerts in Boston. Its conductors were successively
Carl Lenschow and Carl Bergmann and there
seems to be little doubt that it was by far the best
orchestra America had yet heard.</p>

<p>In 1855 Carl Zerrahn, flute player of the Germania,
founded an orchestra which became known as the
Philharmonic and which gave regular concerts in Boston
until 1863. He was invited, in 1866, to the conductorship
of the orchestra newly formed by the Harvard
Musical Association. This was really the first permanent
orchestra of value that greater Boston possessed,
and during the twenty years of its existence it clung
with remarkable consistency to the highest musical
ideals. Included in the works performed by it were
the nine Beethoven symphonies; twelve Haydn and six
Mozart symphonies, Spohr's <em>Die Weihe der Töne</em>;
Schubert's B minor (unfinished) and C major; Mendelssohn's
'Italian,' 'Scotch,' and 'Reformation'; the
four symphonies of Schumann; Gade's First, Second,
Third, and Fourth; two of Raff and two of Brahms;
Rubinstein's 'Ocean'; Berlioz's <em>Fantastique</em>; the Second
of Saint-Saëns; two of Paine; one of Ritter;
Liszt's symphonic poems, <em>Tasso</em> and <em>Les Préludes</em>;
Lachner's first suite and Raff's suite in C; Spohr's
<em>Irdisches und Göttliches</em> for double orchestra; and
overtures by Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn,
Cherubini, Schubert, Weber, Schumann, Gade,
Bennett, Bargiel, Buck, Goldmark, Paine, Chadwick,
Parker, Henschel, Rietz, and others. Nevertheless
the Harvard Orchestra did not receive very warm
support from the people of Boston. Among musicians,
too, there grew up gradually a certain impatience at
its undoubted conservatism and finally a rival was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
started which was organized as the Philharmonic Society
in 1880.</p>

<p>There was not room enough in Boston for two orchestras,
but there was room and need for one good
orchestra which would cater fully to the city's musical
tastes. Such an orchestra needs a sponsor in the shape
of heavy financial backing and the <em>deus ex machina</em>
in this case was Henry L. Higginson, the banker, who
founded the Boston Symphony Orchestra at his own
risk and guaranteed its permanency. Under the leadership
of George Henschel the orchestra opened its first
season in 1881 with Beethoven's 'Dedication of the
House.' It gave twenty concerts that season and
twenty-six in the third season. Since then the regular
number has been twenty-four, in addition to public
rehearsals. Regular visits are made to New York,
Philadelphia, Washington, Providence, and other large
cities, bringing the total number of concerts each season
to the neighborhood of one hundred.</p>

<p>George Henschel returned to Europe in 1884 and
Wilhelm Gericke came over from Vienna as conductor.
To Gericke must be awarded the chief credit for making
the Boston Symphony Orchestra what it is to-day—the
finest in America and one of the most perfectly
balanced and finished symphonic ensembles in the
world. Gericke was a disciplinarian of the most rigid
type and under his iron rule practically all the technical
weaknesses of the orchestra were eliminated. Musically,
like Theodore Thomas, he was an ardent devotee
of Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, and he was
more concerned with strictly traditional interpretations
of the classics than with incursions into new and untried
fields. Just as Thomas in New York had an
ideally suitable successor in Anton Seidl, so Gericke
had an ideally suitable successor in that remarkable
orchestral virtuoso, Arthur Nikisch. Perhaps musical
America has never known anything like the four seasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
during which the temperamental and fiery Nikisch
performed on the perfect instrument which Gericke
had left to his hand. He was succeeded by Emil Paur,
a decided modernist in his tendencies, who made Boston
familiar with Tschaikowsky, Richard Strauss, and
lesser post-Wagnerians. Gericke returned in 1898 and
in the following year Symphony Hall was built. Max
Fiedler was the next conductor, and after him came
the present incumbent of the post—the scholarly and
immaculate Dr. Karl Muck.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When Theodore Thomas left the New York Philharmonic
he accepted the musical directorship of the
American Opera Company, to which we have already
referred in a previous chapter. When he got back to
New York after an absence of two seasons he attempted
to revive his old orchestral organization, in spite of
the fact that there were three competing orchestras
in the field. His attempt was a dismal failure and he
found himself stranded without money, engagements
or prospects. At this ebb-tide of his affairs he met Mr.
C. N. Fay, of Chicago, who inquired whether he would
be willing to go to that city if he were given a permanent
orchestra. 'Oh,' said Thomas, 'I'd go to hell if
you would give me a permanent orchestra.' So he
went to Chicago.</p>

<p>Before the fire of 1871 Chicago had an orchestra of
its own, conducted by Hans Balatka. Then it was
without one until Mr. Fay issued his invitation to Theodore
Thomas in 1890. Fay succeeded in getting fifty
men to guarantee $1,000 each for a season and formed
the Orchestra Association. After taking a year in
which to organize his players, Thomas started the career
of the orchestra that bears his name in 1891. A
most instructive essay might be written upon the succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
of difficulties, financial and other, which the
Theodore Thomas Orchestra was compelled to surmount
before it reached the position of solid permanency
which it now occupies. That it did surmount
those difficulties is due chiefly to the iron obstinacy
of Thomas himself and to the persistent optimism of
Mr. Bryan Lathrop, who steered the enterprise through
many critical situations. Shortly before his death on
January 4, 1905, Thomas succeeded in realizing his
desire to secure for the orchestra a home of its own.
Had he failed in that object it is quite probable that
the orchestra would have been disbanded after his
death, but in succeeding he raised the orchestra to the
position of an institution in which Chicago has since
taken an increasingly great pride.</p>

<p>Thomas was succeeded in the conductorship by Frederick
A. Stock, who still holds the post. We have had
occasion to point out before that Thomas was very
fortunate in his successors. In Chicago, as elsewhere,
his conservatism held him more or less closely to the
classics and his interpretations of these established a
high and dignified standard which was of incalculable
value in educating the public taste. Accepting this
standard as his own, Mr. Stock ventured gradually into
new paths and, while still maintaining the classic tradition,
he led his public into greater intimacy with the
moderns. César Franck, d'Indy, Debussy, Chausson,
Glazounoff, Gretchaninoff, Balakireff, Borodine, Sinigaglia,
Max Reger, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler have
all figured on his programs, together with Bach, Beethoven,
and Brahms, with Haydn and Mozart, with
Schubert, Schumann and Mendelssohn, with Wagner,
Liszt, and Tschaikowsky. Like the other big American
orchestras, the Theodore Thomas organization
makes an annual tour, bringing to the smaller cities
their meed of musical entertainment and to the larger
ones an opportunity of comparing notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>In spite of the great strides made by Chicago in musical
culture during recent years, its importance in the
musical history of the Middle West is second to that of
Cincinnati. From the beginning the elements composing
the citizenship of the latter city were such as to
introduce musical activity at a very early stage. The
first <em>Sängerfest</em> in the West was held at the old Armory
Hall there about 1842, and in 1878 the Cincinnati College
of Music, equipped to teach all branches, was
founded by Miss Dora Nelson.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati College of Music, which has since
become the College of Music of Cincinnati, became the
vibrant centre of musical growth in the Middle West.
It was never without its own orchestra, string quartet,
chorus and school of opera and expression. Through
its faculty concerts, lectures, and other forms of educational
entertainments the people of Cincinnati became
interested and discriminating auditors.</p>

<p>Theodore Thomas was the first musical director of
this school, and it was from Cincinnati that he first
exercised the influence which has since resulted in such
remarkable advance in all musical centres of the Middle
West. The first May Music Festival to be given
in America was organized and performed under his
direction in 1873. Five years later, during which time
the Cincinnati Festival had become an established institution,
the Springer Music Hall was erected for the
future use of the May Festival Association.</p>

<p>The May Festivals were given loyal public support
and were successful from the beginning. Choral societies
were numerous and the cause of advanced musical
education found sincere support in every section of
the city. The first orchestra to give public concerts
was organized and operated by Michael Brand, a 'cellist
of considerable local fame. He had gathered about him
the more advanced of the local musicians and in 1894<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
an orchestra of forty men was giving concerts under
his direction.</p>

<p>In 1895 public spirited women, interested in the advancement
of music, conceived the idea of establishing
a regular symphony orchestra on a substantial
basis through public subscription. This movement was
led by the Ladies' Musical Club, of which Miss Emma
L. Roedter was president and Mrs. William Howard
Taft, wife of the later President of the United States,
secretary. The conception of the plan that was followed
is accredited to Miss Helen Sparrman, at that
time honorary president of the Ladies' Musical Club.
As a result, the Cincinnati Orchestra Association Company
was organized and nine concerts were given under
its direction during the season 1895-96.</p>

<p>The season was divided into three series of three
concerts each, and three prospective conductors, all
of them men of wide experience, were engaged to conduct
a series each.</p>

<p>Following the performance of these trial concerts
ten thousand dollars was secured by public subscription
and the succeeding fall an orchestra of forty-eight
men, with Frank Van der Stucken as permanent conductor,
was established. The first regular season in
1895-96 consisted of ten pairs of concerts given in Pike's
Opera House, on Friday afternoons and Saturday evenings,
from November 20 to April 11, inclusive. The
orchestra was increased to seventy men during the
season 1896-97 and the concerts transferred to Music
Hall, where they were given until the winter of 1911.
About this time Mrs. Thomas J. Emery had begun the
construction of a building for the use of the Ohio Mechanics
Institute and the auditorium was so constructed
that it could be made the home of the orchestra, which
at this time was being operated under the corporation
title of The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra Association
Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Van der Stucken's incumbency as conductor of
the orchestra ended in 1906. The concerts given by
the association during the season 1907-08 were given
with orchestras from other cities and in 1908 no concerts
were given. During the summer of 1909, however,
the association, under the leadership of Mrs.
Holmes, placed the orchestra on a permanent basis by
raising a subscription fund of fifty thousand dollars a
year for five years. Mr. Leopold Stokowski was installed
as conductor and ten pairs of concerts were
given the following year. The orchestra numbered
sixty-five men.</p>

<p>The season 1911-12 was marked by an increase to
seventy-seven men. On the retirement of Mrs. Holmes
as president, the orchestra had been brought up to a
membership of eighty-two men and Mr. Stokowski had
been succeeded by the present conductor, Dr. Ernst
Kunwald, for five years an associate of Arthur Nikisch
in the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>

<p>The orchestra's sphere of influence began to extend
beyond the environs of Cincinnati in 1900. Since that
time it has made annual tours, visiting Pittsburgh, Buffalo,
Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo, Detroit, Grand
Rapids, Indianapolis, Louisville, Terre Haute, Oberlin,
Akron, Dayton, Springfield, Kansas City, Omaha,
Wichita, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Chicago, and other cities
of the Middle West and South.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh, like all other cities preëminently industrial,
has developed but slowly that side of its civic
life in which the arts find important place, and not
until 1873 did it possess a musical body that might
properly be called an orchestra. This was known as
the 'Germania' and was founded and conducted by
George Toerge. It consisted of from thirty-five to forty-two
instruments and its programs were made up chiefly
of symphony movements, overtures, and lighter music.
There was nothing very ambitious in its aims or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
achievements, but undoubtedly it was not without its
influence in preparing the way for others. Later Carl
Retter organized what was known as Retter's Orchestra,
which, under his leadership and that of Fidelis Zitterbart,
continued valiantly the pioneer work done by
the Germania. Its first concert was devoted to Gluck,
Beethoven, Boccherini, Johann Strauss, and Keler-Bela.
Retter was succeeded in 1879 by Adolph M. Foerster,
who conducted the orchestra for the next two
years.</p>

<p>As yet there was not sufficient interest in musical
affairs in Pittsburgh to support a permanent orchestra
worthy of the city, but there were a number of valuable
musical organizations, such as the Gounod Club,
the Symphonic Society, the Art Society, and the Mozart
Club, which, singly or together, did excellent work in
providing orchestral concerts. Then came the twenty-eighth
National Saengerfest, which was held in Pittsburgh
in 1896 and which inaugurated an epoch in the
musical affairs of the city. This festival, to quote Mr.
Adolph Foerster, 'aroused the first impulse of bringing
order out of the chaos existing at that time. It
was to create an orchestra for this great event and thus
lay the foundation for a permanent organization to give
concerts at Carnegie Hall, then nearing completion.
Though concerts were begun a few months after the
dedication of the hall, the orchestra was not, however,
engaged, since the elaborate programs designed excluded
the possibilities of adequate interpretations by
the orchestra as then equipped. Perhaps to no other
one man than to Charles W. Scovel is due the credit
of solving the intricate problem of establishing the
guarantee fund, bringing the different elements into
harmony, and thus making the orchestra a possibility.'</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra gave its first
concert on February 27, 1896, with Frederic Archer as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
conductor and with a program that included compositions
of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Rameau, Saint-Saëns,
Massenet, Liszt, and Wagner. In 1898 Archer was succeeded
in the conductorship by Victor Herbert, whose
brilliance, verve, and tendency toward the picturesque
in music appealed strongly to the Pittsburgh public and
established for his orchestra of sixty-five men a popularity
which a more severe and conservative leader
might have failed to attract. Theodore Thomas always
took his position firmly on the heights and compelled
his audience to climb up to him; Herbert adopted the
reverse method, starting in the pleasant, flower-decked
plain and cheerfully leading his public by his hand
to more stimulating altitudes. Possibly his plan was
not the best sort of educational discipline, but it seems
to have been productive of good results. Emil Paur,
who succeeded him in 1910, paid more respect to the
great gods on high Olympus, bowing down with especial
reverence before the shrine of Brahms. 'It must be
recorded,' says Mr. Foerster, 'that ever since Mr. Paur
has conducted the orchestra the non-local financial as
well as artistic successes have been much increased.
The orchestra is a regular visitor each season to many
large cities.... Each season the demand for the orchestra
has increased, and thus it has become a national
educator, a notable benefactor in the musical
development of this country, probably traversing a
larger area than any of the great symphony orchestras.'
In addition to its regular conductors the orchestra has
at various times played under the leadership of guest
conductors, including Richard Strauss, Eugen d'Albert,
Walter Damrosch, and Edward Elgar.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of recent musical
history in the United States is the remarkable growth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
of musical culture in the West. So rapid has been
this growth, so widely has it spread, so numerous and
varied are the activities it has brought in its train that
it would be impossible to follow it in any detail. The
number of musical clubs and organizations which have
sprung up in recent years in the vast territory between
the Mississippi and the Pacific is too great even to be
catalogued in a general sketch of this nature. In many
of the large cities, however, some of these organizations
have reached a position of national importance
and rival the best products of the older cities of the
East. Notable among those is the Minneapolis Symphony
Orchestra, which is generally conceded to rank
with the Boston Symphony, the Theodore Thomas Orchestra,
and the New York Philharmonic. It owes
its inception entirely to Emil Oberhoffer, who started
it as a support for the chorus of the Philharmonic Society
of Minneapolis, of which he was conductor. He
succeeded in obtaining a guarantee of $30,000 for three
years, then one of $90,000 for three years, and finally
one of $65,000 annually for three years. With that
backing he was able to organize and perfect an orchestral
body which has few equals in America and of
which he still remains conductor. During its first season
the orchestra gave six concerts. Since then the
number has increased to forty annually. After its
regular season the orchestra makes a spring tour extending
from Winnipeg in the North to Birmingham,
Ala., in the South, and from Akron in the East to
Wichita in the West. St. Paul also has an excellent
orchestra, organized in 1905, which gives a season of
ten concerts, seventeen popular Sunday afternoon concerts,
and three children's concerts—so that, on the
whole, the twin cities are very generously supplied
with orchestral music.</p>

<p>San Francisco, curiously enough, has been somewhat
tardy in orchestral matters and it was not until 1911<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
that it organized an orchestra of any importance. So
far the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under the
leadership of Henry Hadley, has done excellent work.
During its three seasons it has given five symphonies of
Beethoven, three of Brahms, one of Dvořák, one of
César Franck, two of Hadley, one of Haydn, three of
Mozart, one of Rachmaninoff, two of Schubert, one of

Humperdinck, Lalo, Liszt, MacDowell, Massenet,
Mendelssohn, Moszkowski, Nicolai, Ravel, Reger, Rimsky-Korsakoff,

Smetana, Johann Strauss, Richard Strauss, Svendsen,

many others—it would be impossible to conceive of a
more catholic assemblage.</p>

<p>Seattle has a fine symphony orchestra of its own, and
in the Southwest Denver shines as the possessor of an
ambitious symphonic organization. Since 1907 St.
Louis has had a good orchestra under the leadership
of Carl Zach. In 1911 The Kansas City Musical Club,
a women's organization, succeeded in promoting an
Orchestra Association to guarantee the losses of an orchestra
which is doing good work under the leadership
of Carl Busch. Los Angeles, Wichita, Cleveland, Detroit,
and other Western and Middle Western cities also
have creditable orchestras of their own.</p>

<p>Returning East we note the orchestra of the Peabody
Institute in Baltimore and the symphony orchestras
of Atlanta, Washington, New Haven, and Buffalo.
These are all relatively modest organizations, but they
supplement excellently the work of the large visiting
orchestras. Philadelphia, however, possesses an orchestra
which has now definitely taken its place among
the greatest in the country. It is the outgrowth of
about fifty amateur and semi-professional musicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
who, between 1893 and 1900, gave a few concerts each
season at the Academy of Music under the leadership
of Dr. W. W. Gilchrist. These men formed the nucleus
of a permanent orchestra of seventy-two players, which
was organized in 1900. Fritz Scheel, then conducting
an orchestra at one of Philadelphia's summer parks,
was appointed conductor. Under him the important
formative work was solidly accomplished and when
Carl Pohlig, first court conductor at Stuttgart, came
over as conductor in 1907 he found at his disposal a
finished ensemble. Pohlig was succeeded by Leopold
Stokowski in 1912. The latter's knowledge of American
traditions and artistic needs, gained at first while
conductor of the Cincinnati orchestra, served to put him
in sympathy with the musical desires and ideals of his
public and the success of the orchestra under his leadership
has been very marked. Besides its regular season
of fifty-one concerts (season of 1913-14) the Philadelphia
orchestra gives a number of popular concerts,
fills many engagements in nearby towns and cities, and
makes two tours of a week each in the Middle West
and New England.</p>

<p>'Believing that a great orchestral organization should
have an educational influence'—we quote from the
prospectus of the Philadelphia orchestra—'he (Mr.
Stokowski) chooses the compositions to be played from
all periods and all schools and arranges his programs
in the manner which he considers most likely to prove
both pleasure-giving and enlightening. The list of programs
for the past season (1913-14) included two devoted
wholly to Wagner, one of which was made up
of excerpts from the four operas of the "Ring," presented
in their natural sequence. From Bach to Richard
Strauss, from Gluck to Erich Korngold—the repertory,
though kept always up to his high standard, is
inclusive and comprehensive. It touches upon all fields
of music, faltering before no technical requirements—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
is nothing in the most modern range of the most
complicated orchestral works that the orchestra has
not at one time or another essayed, one of its achievements
being the entirely successful performance of
Richard Strauss's tremendous <em>Sinfonia Domestica</em>.'</p>

<p>Altogether, in orchestral matters America has sufficient
reason to be proud of her attainments. Of
course, one cannot argue from the existence of good
orchestras the coincidence of a high or widely diffused
state of musical culture. They are to some extent the
joint product of money and civic pride. But their
educational influence is beyond question and thus we
may at least argue from the increasing number of good
orchestras in America a bright promise for the future.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Aside from purely orchestral organizations there has
been in recent years, especially in the larger cities, an
increasing number of societies devoted to the study
of special phases of musical art and which give occasional
illustrative concerts with orchestra. As these
are quasi-social in their activities and somewhat restricted
in their appeal, their influence on the musical
culture of the country generally is not of much account.
Quite the opposite, however, is true of the large number
of important ensembles devoted to the performance
of chamber music. The growth of public interest
in the smaller instrumental forms promoted by these
ensembles is not the least interesting and significant
feature of musical conditions in present-day America.
It might not, perhaps, be extreme to say that a real
appreciation of chamber music is the identifying mark
of true musical cultivation, and the ever-increasing
public which patronizes the concerts of chamber music
organizations in this country is one of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
encouraging signs patriotic American music-lovers
could wish to see.</p>

<p>Probably we must go back to our charming old
friends, the cavaliers of Virginia, with their 'chests of
viols' and their compositions of Boccherini and Vivaldi,
to find the beginnings of chamber-music in
America. Undoubtedly small private ensembles antedated
orchestras in this country as they did everywhere
else. We know that at Governor Penn's house in Philadelphia
Francis Hopkinson and his friends met together
frequently for musical entertainment, and such
gatherings must have been numerous in New York,
Boston, Charleston, and other colonial centres of culture.
However, we must grope along until well into
the nineteenth century before we find a public appearance
in America of a chamber music ensemble. The
pioneer, as far as we can discover, was a string quartet
brought together in 1843 by Uriah C. Hill, founder of
the New York Philharmonic. Samuel Johnson, an
original member of the Philharmonic, writes about this
quartet as follows: 'A miserable failure, artistically
and financially. It would be gross flattery to call Mr.
Hill a third-rate violinist; Apelles was a good clarinet,
but a poor violinist.... Lehmann was a good second
flute; Hegelund was a bassoon player and naturally
best adapted to that instrument; he was a very small-sized
man, with hands too small to grasp the neck of
the 'cello. The whole enterprise was dead at its conception.'
But perhaps Mr. Johnson did not like Mr.
Hill. Richard Grant White said that the <em>soirées</em> of the
Hill Quartet 'were well attended and successful.'</p>

<p>In 1846, however, New York was treated to a quartet
headed by the great Sivori. 'This was something like
a real quartet' according to Samuel Johnson. Three
years later Saroni's 'Musical Times' arranged a series
of four chamber music concerts in which the best artists
in New York appeared. The program of the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
concert included Mozart's D minor string quartet, Beethoven's
B flat piano trio, and Mendelssohn's D minor
piano trio—rather a choice dish. Then came Theodore
Eisfeld, who, in 1851, established a string quartet
that set a very high mark for its successors to shoot at.
At its first concert it presented Haydn's Quartet, No. 78,
in B flat, Mendelssohn's trio in D minor, and Beethoven's
quartet No. 1, in F major. Eisfeld maintained
that standard for several years, clinging religiously to
Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Spohr.
And, furthermore, his <em>soirées</em> were well patronized.
Beyond question he created a real demand for that
sort of thing, so that in 1855, at the suggestion of Dr.
William Mason, Carl Bergmann instituted a series of
<em>soirées</em> for the performance of chamber music and
organized a quartet consisting of himself, Theodore
Thomas, Joseph Mosenthal, and George Matzka. Mason
was pianist. These concerts, known first as the
Mason and Bergmann and then as the Mason and
Thomas series, were continued every season (except
that of 1856-57) until 1866. They improved considerably
on the work done by Eisfeld, adding to the names
of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven on their programs
those of Schumann, Rubinstein, Brahms, Raff, and
other contemporaries.</p>

<p>Boston in the meantime had been initiated into the
beauties of chamber music by the Harvard Musical
Association, which gave a regular series of <em>soirées</em>
there every year between 1844 and 1850. Stimulated
by the success of these affairs, five professional musicians—August
Fries, Francis Riha, Edward Lehman,
Thomas Ryan, and Wulf Fries, to wit—organized the
Mendelssohn Quintet Club. This was the first important
chamber music ensemble in America and for
nearly fifty years it continued to cultivate its chosen
field, not only in Boston, but all over the United States.
Its first concert included Mendelssohn's Quintet, op. 8,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
a concertante of Kalliwoda for flute, violin and 'cello,
and Beethoven's Quintet, op. 4. The Mendelssohn
Quintet Club was an active and progressive organization,
keeping well up with contemporary composition
and frequently augmenting its members so as to give
sextets, septets, octets, nonets, and other larger chamber-music
forms.</p>

<p>The next noteworthy chamber music organization in
the East was the Beethoven Quintet Club formed in
Boston in 1873. Then came the era of what we might
call the Boston Symphony graduates, viz., the Kneisel
Quartet, the Hoffman Quartet, the Adamowski Quartet,
and the Longy Club (wind instruments)—all offshoots
of the same great orchestra. Of these perhaps
the most notable is the Kneisel Quartet (founded in
1884), which has won a deservedly high reputation as
well for its splendid interpretations of standard compositions
as for its frequent presentation of interesting
novelties. Since 1905 the Kneisel Quartet has made
New York its headquarters and like the Flonzaleys and
other organizations tours the entire country every season.
In 1904 Mr. Kneisel's successor as concertmeister
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Prof. Willy Hess,
founded the Boston Symphony Quartet, which has
since then given concerts of very high standard in Boston
and elsewhere. The Longy Club of wind instruments
(founded in 1899) is also a noteworthy organization
and does work of the highest artistic excellence in
a field but slightly exploited. Among other chamber
music ensembles which have seen the light in Boston
may be mentioned the Theodorowicz Quartet, the Olive
Mead Quartet, the Eaton-Hadley Trio, and the Bostonia
Quintet Club, composed of string quartet and clarinet.</p>

<p>New York is not quite so well favored in this respect,
but it possesses several chamber music organizations of
some distinction. Chief of them is the Flonzaley Quartet,
which in point of individuality has probably no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
peer in America. The Barrère Ensemble of woodwinds,
headed by George Barrère, first flutist of the
New York Symphony Society, is also an organization
of exceptional excellence, though it does not possess
the perfect balance and all-round finish of the
Longy Club. Among others, the Marum Quartet, the
Margulies Trio, and the New York Trio are worthy of
note.</p>

<p>In Chicago the principal chamber music organizations
are the Heerman Quartet and the Chicago String
Quartet. Practically every other city of importance
in the country has one or more such ensembles, some
of them professional, some of them semi-professional
and some of them amateur. While the private performance
of chamber music in any community usually
precedes the institution of public concerts, regular professional
bodies follow as a rule the establishment of
large orchestras; hence it would be futile to look for
good chamber music ensembles outside the principal
cities.</p>

<p>The activities of the musical clubs all over the country
include in a majority of cases the occasional performance
of chamber music works. In the small towns
these are usually private, social affairs; in the large
cities they often succeed in reaching a wide public.
There are literally thousands of such clubs in the
United States and their influence in the promotion of
musical appreciation is very great. Of course, many
of them are namby-pamby pink tea gatherings, leaning
languidly toward the Godard's Berceuse style of composition
and conversational clap-trap touching art and
artists. But the majority of them, we are inclined to
believe, are serious in aim and accomplish an amount
of good in their immediate environment. It is worthy
of remark that a very large proportion of them are
composed exclusively of women.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Unquestionably an epoch in the cultivation of choral
music in America was inaugurated by the foundation
of the Boston Handel and Haydn Society in 1815.
Whether or not there is anything in the theory that
American musical organizations had their genesis in
the singing classes of Massachusetts, it may scarcely
be denied that the cultivation of ensemble singing received
earlier and more serious attention in New England
than elsewhere in this country. The reason is
sufficiently obvious. The people of New England were
a church-going race, and singing, even when Puritan
asceticism was most intense, was an essential factor
of religious services. As soon as the New England conscience
was convinced that good singing was no more
frivolous and immoral than bad singing the people
turned with characteristic zeal to choral practice and
singing societies throughout the land became as common
as Sunday-schools. These societies were very distinct
in character from other American musical organizations,
and the distinction was entirely in their favor.
They were the outgrowth of a real and widely felt
popular need; they had a practical purpose in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
all their members were seriously interested. On the
contrary, the other early musical societies for the most
part were promoted by wealthy amateurs from motives
which at best were not free from suspicion of dilettantism
and at worst were purely snobbish.</p>

<p>The nucleus of the Handel and Haydn Society was
the choir of the Park Street Church and the moving
spirit in its formation was Gottlieb Graupner, whose
services to music in Boston we have already noticed.
Associated with him were Asa Peabody and Thomas
Webb Smith. The society, according to its pre-organization
announcement, was formed with the object 'of
cultivating and improving a correct taste in the performance
of sacred music'—a phrase which recalls
the exhortations of the Rev. Thomas Symmes and his
colleagues a century earlier. On Christmas evening,
1815, according to the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, the
first concert of the society was given 'to a delighted
audience of nine hundred and forty-five persons, with
the Russian Consul, the well-remembered Mr. Eustaphieve,
assisting as one of the performers in the orchestra.'
The first program was appropriately devoted
altogether to Handel and Haydn.</p>

<p>The growth of the society to a position of commanding
artistic stature was rapid. In 1818 it gave a performance
of the 'Messiah' complete—possibly for the
first time in America.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In the following year the 'Creation'
was given, and the 'Dettingen Te Deum' followed
soon after. It would seem that the society in
1823 unofficially commissioned Beethoven to write an
oratorio for its use,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and that fact alone would indicate
that it had come to take itself very seriously indeed.
Masses by Haydn and Mozart, the larger part of Beethoven's
'Mount of Olives,' Handel's 'Samson,' and Donizetti's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
'Martyrs' were features of the society's work
between 1825 and 1850.</p>


<p>Until 1847 the Handel and Haydn was conducted by
its successive presidents, the most notable of whom
were Thomas Smith Webb, Lowell Mason, and Jonas
Chickering. Then the offices of president and conductor
were dissociated. Carl Bergmann became conductor
in 1852 and in 1854 he was succeeded by Carl
Zerrahn, who occupies a prominent place in the history
of musical progress in Boston. He remained with the
Handel and Haydn until 1895, after which came Benjamin
J. Lang and Emil Mollenhauer, successively.</p>

<p>The Handel and Haydn Society bulks so large in the
musical life of Boston that the other choral organizations
of the city are somewhat excessively overshadowed.
But there are a number of excellent and distinctive
societies which deserve more than passing
mention. Chief of these is the Choral Art Society organized
in 1901 by Mr. Wallace Goodrich, in imitation
of the Musical Art Society of New York, for the study
and performance of works of the Palestrina school,
Bach, and the more modern masters of <em>a cappella</em> music.
The Apollo Club, founded in 1871, is one of the
best male choruses in the country and the Cecilia Society,
dating from 1877, is noted for its presentation
of interesting novelties. Of particular importance, too,
is the People's Choral Union, a chorus of four hundred
voices, recruited from the working classes.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The splendid work done by the Sacred Music Society
of New York has been noticed in a previous chapter.
Unfortunately the society did not live long. During
the last five years of its existence it had a robust
rival in the Musical Institute, a chorus of one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
and twenty voices under the leadership of H. C. Timm,
which has to its credit performances of Haydn's 'Seasons'
(1846) and Schumann's 'Paradise and the Peri'
(1848) among others.</p>

<p>In choral as in orchestral matters New York was
suffering from too much competition. Out of the débris
of the two chief competitors arose, in 1849, the New
York Harmonic Society, which lived until 1863 under
the successive conductorships of Timm, Eisfeld, Bristow,
Bergmann, Morgan, Ritter, and James Peck. In
its own way the Harmonic Society was just as important
and efficient as the Philharmonic, but longevity decidedly
was not a feature of New York choral organizations.
Out of the remains of the Harmonic came
the Mendelssohn Union, of which Bristow, Morgan,
Bergmann, and Theodore Thomas were successively
conductors, and then followed the Choral Music Association,
a most exclusively fashionable organization.</p>

<p>The complaint from which New York choral societies
were suffering at that time might accurately be
diagnosed as anemia and it was fortunate that for
several years previously there had been a large influx
to the city of red Germanic blood. In 1847 a number
of these lusty Germans got together and formed a male
chorus which they called <em>Deutscher Liederkranz</em>.
There was life in the <em>Liederkranz</em>, and art and sincerity
and enthusiasm and everything that ought to be
in a musical society. It gave a tremendous impulse
to the art of choral singing in New York and the extent
of its influence in the musical life of the community
cannot easily be overestimated. The list of
important works performed by it would be too long
to quote here, but we may mention, as illustrating the
quality of its taste, Mozart's <em>Requiem</em>, Mendelssohn's
<em>Walpurgisnacht</em>, Haydn's <em>Schöpfung</em>, Schumann's <em>Des
Sänger's Fluch</em>, Schubert's <em>Chor der Geister über dem
Wasser</em> and <em>Die Verschworenen</em>, Liszt's <em>Prometheus</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
Meyerbeer's 'Ninth Psalm,' Bruch's <em>Odysseus</em>, Brahms'
<em>Ein deutsches Requiem</em> and <em>Schicksalslied</em>, and Hoffman's
<em>Melusine</em> and <em>Aschenbrödel</em>. There has been
nothing anemic about the <em>Liederkranz</em>. In 1856 it admitted
women to its choruses. This step had been contemplated
for some years and in connection therewith
there had been vigorous warfare within the ranks of
the society. As a result the anti-feminist irreconcilables
seceded in 1854 and formed the <em>Männergesangverein
Arion</em>, which has since travelled at a musical
pace as lively as that of its parent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have not space to speak of the
splendid work accomplished by the Arion during the
sixty years of its existence. Not the least of its services
to music in America was the introduction of Dr. Leopold
Damrosch, who conducted it for several years.
In 1873 it occurred to Dr. Damrosch that New York
needed a society which would give the larger forms of
choral music in a competent fashion. The Mendelssohn
Union and the Church Music Association still existed.
Both had done excellent work, the latter having been
responsible for the first performance in America of
Beethoven's Mass in D. But, possibly because of their
own peculiar lack of vigorous life, they failed to attract
the public. That the need for such an organization as
the Oratorio Society, which Dr. Damrosch founded in
1873, was very real is sufficiently proved by its rapid
success. The new society avoided the mistake made
by all its predecessors in starting too pretentiously and
began with a few modest concerts of a miscellaneous
nature. But by the time death deprived it of its founder
in 1885 it had placed to its credit achievements in
choral music such as had never been approached by
any other organization in New York, or, in fact, elsewhere
in America. These included the great choral
classics: Beethoven's 'Ninth Symphony,' Bach's 'St.
Matthew's Passion,' Handel's 'Messiah' and 'Judas Maccabæus,'
Mendelssohn's 'Elijah' and 'St. Paul,' Haydn's
'Creation,' Brahms' 'A German Requiem,' and others,
together with first performances in America of Berlioz's
<em>Damnation de Faust</em> and <em>Requiem</em>, Frederick H.
Cowen's 'St. Ursula,' Leopold Damrosch's 'Ruth and
Naomi' and 'Sulamith,' Kiel's <em>Christus</em>, and Liszt's
<em>Christus</em>. We may also mention performances in concert
form of Gluck's <em>Orpheus</em>, Berlioz's <em>Les Troyens</em>,
and Wagner's <em>Parsifal</em> (excerpts).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Damrosch was succeeded by his son Walter, who
conducted the society until 1889, introducing to America
Berlioz's <em>Te Deum</em>, his own 'Scarlet Letter' and
'Manila Te Deum,' Gounod's 'Redemption,' Edward
Grell's <em>Missa Solemnis</em>, George Henschel's <em>Stabat Mater</em>,
Gustav Mahler's 'Choral Symphony' (No. 2), Horatio
Parker's 'St. Christopher,' Saint-Saëns' 'Samson and
Delilah,' Heinrich Schütz's 'Seven Last Words,' Edgar
Tinel's 'St. Francis of Assisi,' and Tschaikowsky's
'Legend,' <em>Pater noster</em>, and <em>Eugen Onegin</em>. He also
gave a complete version in concert form of <em>Parsifal</em>.
Frank Damrosch, another son of Dr. Damrosch, became
conductor of the society in 1889. In the meantime
Mr. Andrew Carnegie had become interested in
the work and it was mainly this interest which led
him to build the Carnegie Music Hall. The Oratorio
Society, which had given its concerts successively in
Steinway Hall, the Academy of Music, and the Metropolitan
Opera House, moved to the new hall in 1891,
celebrating the event with a festival made memorable
by the presence of Tschaikowsky as a guest conductor.
During his twelve years as conductor of the society Mr.
Frank Damrosch raised its repertory to eighty-six compositions,
adding fourteen works to the list. Several
of these were given for the first time in America, including
Sir Edward Elgar's 'The Apostles' and 'The
Kingdom,' Gabriel Pierné's 'The Children's Crusade,'
Strauss's 'Taillefer,' and Wolf-Ferrari's <em>La vita nuova</em>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Other important performances were Bach's 'B Minor
Mass' and Beethoven's 'Mass in D.' Chicago anticipated
the Oratorio Society by three days in the first
American performance of Elgar's 'The Dream of
Gerontius.' In 1912 it collaborated with the Symphony
Society in a Brahms festival, singing 'Nenia,' the 'Triumphal
Hymn,' and 'A German Requiem.' Frank
Damrosch resigned in the same year and was succeeded
by Louis Koemmenich. The novelties of Mr.
Koemmenich's first two seasons were Otto Taubmann's
<em>Eine Deutsche Messe</em> and Georg Schumann's 'Ruth,'
and there were two performances of the 'Ninth Symphony'
in conjunction with the Symphony Society at a
Beethoven festival in 1914.</p>

<p>In 1893 Frank Damrosch organized a professional
chorus under the title of the Musical Art Society, for
the performance of <em>a cappella</em> works of Bach, the Palestrina
school, and more modern masters. The society
was quite different from any choral organization that
had ever been formed in America, aiming at the interpretation
of a style of music that is in the highest
degree difficult and unusual. To cover acceptably the
field of <em>a cappella</em> music from Josquin des Près, Palestrina,
Orlando di Lasso, Eccard, Gabrieli and Orlando
Gibbons to Debussy, d'Indy and Richard Strauss is an
artistic enterprise which only a chorus of artists, one
would think, would venture to undertake. The Musical
Art Society has succeeded very well in its difficult
task and its concerts are invariably among the
most interesting events of the New York season. Its
repertory to date includes the names of over one hundred
composers, with special emphasis on Palestrina,
Bach, and Brahms, and it includes also a large number
of delightful old <em>Minnelieder</em>, mediæval hymns and
German, Scandinavian, Scotch, French, Bohemian, and
English folk-songs.</p>

<p>Similar work is done by the Schola Cantorum, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Kurt Schindler, which has given especially interesting
programs of old troubadour songs and madrigals of
the French renaissance. It was originally organized,
under the auspices of the MacDowell Club, as the MacDowell
Chorus. The Lambord Choral Society, organized
under the conductorship of Benjamin Lambord
in 1912, is devoted to the study and performance
of small, rarely heard choral works by modern
composers. During its first season its activities included
a series of chamber music concerts, as well as
a concert with chorus and orchestra in celebration of
the centenary of Wagner's birth. The Modern Music
Society was organized in 1913, with the Lambord
Choral Society as one of its constituent parts. The new
society made its first public appearance with a noteworthy
concert devoted altogether to works of modern
American composers, its avowed purpose being the encouragement
of native composition.</p>

<p>Among other New York choral organizations may be
mentioned the United Singers and the People's Choral
Union, which may be cited as a prominent example of
community music in a large city. The People's Choral
Union and Singing Classes were established in 1892 by
Frank Damrosch in close affiliation with the work of
the Cooper Institute, established to disseminate knowledge
and culture among the people, particularly working
men and women.</p>

<p>In Brooklyn the Oratorio Society and the Choral
Society are probably the best of a number of good
choruses, though in Brooklyn, as in most big cities,
there are several German singing societies which excel
in their own particular field.</p>

<p>Considering its great musical activity, Philadelphia is
not especially conspicuous for its choral organizations,
but the Orpheus Club, a male chorus founded in 1872,
the Cecilia Society, founded in 1875, and the Philadelphia
Chorus Society are worthy of mention. By far the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
most interesting centre of choral music in Pennsylvania
is the Moravian settlement of Bethlehem, which
since its foundation in 1741 has been cultivating that
branch of musical art with splendid sincerity and idealism.
As early as 1811 Haydn's 'Creation' was performed
there; Bach's great B minor Mass was given
by the Bach Choir of Bethlehem for the first time in
America in 1900, and in 1903 the choir held a Bach
festival during which it performed the entire 'Christmas
Oratorio,' the <em>Magnificat</em>, 'St. Matthew's Passion,'
and the B minor Mass.</p>

<p>Of course, every city and town of any size in the
East has one or more singing societies which do their
own fair share in entertaining and improving it musically.
It would be impossible to enumerate them. New
England is, as it always has been, an especially lively
centre of choral work, and such cities as Portland, Me.,
Springfield and Concord, Mass., Burlington, Vt., and
New Haven, Conn., possess highly trained and efficient
choruses. Of particular interest is the Worcester
County Musical Association, of Worcester, Mass., an
outgrowth of the old musical conventions held for the
purpose of promoting church music. It was organized
in 1863 and for a few years confined itself to psalm-tunes
and simple, sentimental cantatas; but it soon
graduated to Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Rossini,
Verdi, Gounod, and other serious composers of oratorios
and masses. The annual festivals of the association
now rank among the most important events of the
American musical year.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the West Cincinnati takes the lead as a pioneer
in choral music. As early as 1819 there was a Haydn
Society in Cincinnati which seems to have been the
successor of an older organization. Its first concert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
was devoted to Handel and Haydn, and its second
included also Mozart. Soon afterward were born the
Episcopal Singing Society and the Euterpean Society.
Then came the Sacred Music Society and the Amateur
Musical Association. The latter gave the 'Creation' in
1853. Coincidentally there grew up a number of Männerchor
societies, which in 1849, collaborating with
several similar bodies in neighboring towns, organized
the first of the great <em>Sängerfeste</em> already mentioned.
In 1856 the Cecilia Society came into being and inaugurated
a new era for choral music in Cincinnati. At
its first concert it performed Mendelssohn's 'Forty-second
Psalm,' a cantata of Mozart, a chorus for female
voices from Spontini's <em>Vestale</em>, Haydn's 'Come,
Gentle Spring,' and some choruses from Schneider's
'Last Judgment.' Subsequently it presented other
works of Haydn, Mozart, and Mendelssohn, as well as
compositions of Beethoven, Schumann, Handel, Gluck,
Gade, Neukomm, Weber, and Wagner.</p>

<p>The next important society in Cincinnati was the
Cincinnati Harmonic, out of which grew the Festival
Chorus Society. The latter was organized in connection
with the Cincinnati May Festivals which started in
1873 and in which thirty-six societies from the West
and Northwest, including over one thousand singers,
participated. The stimulation furnished by this and
subsequent coöperative festivals resulted, as Theodore
Thomas hopefully predicted, in sending 'new life and
vigor into the whole musical body of the West.' Cincinnati
still retains its activity in choral music and
possesses a large number of excellent singing societies,
most of which are German. Among these we may mention
the Männerchor and the Orpheus as perhaps the
most conspicuous.</p>

<p>It would indeed be impossible to estimate fully the
value the influence exercised by Germans and German
singing societies had on the cultivation of music in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
America. In Milwaukee, for example, the <em>Musikverein</em>,
organized in 1849, stood for years as a beacon light of
musical culture, shedding its rays far and near over
the artistic darkness of the newly settled West. 'The
elements of which the <em>Musik-Verein</em> was composed,'
says Ritter, 'were many-sided. There were to be found
that German indigenous growth, the <em>Männerchor</em> (male
chorus), the orchestra, the chorus composed of male
and female voices, amateurs performing the different
solo parts. The whole field of modern musical forms
was cultivated by those enthusiastic German colonists,
the male-chorus glee, the cantata, the oratorio, the opera,
chamber music in its divers forms, the overture,
the symphony were placed on the programs of this
active society. Its musical life was a rich one and its
influence through the West was of great bearing on a
healthy musical development.'</p>

<p>There are over twenty German choruses in Milwaukee;
in St. Louis there are probably as many, while
in Chicago the number is beyond count—there are
certainly more than one hundred. St. Louis started its
musical life rather early and established a Philharmonic
Society in 1838. Seven years later a Polyhymnia Society
was formed and about the same time a Cecilian
Society and an Oratorio Society came into being. A
new Philharmonic Society was organized in 1859 and
later came the St. Louis Choral Society. These, of
course, leave out of account the German societies, of
which the most prominent are the <em>Liederkranz</em>, the
<em>Socialer Sängerchor</em>, the <em>Germania Sängerbund</em>, the
Orpheus, and the <em>Schweizer Männerchor</em>. As early as
1858 Chicago had a Musical Union devoted to the study
of oratorio. During the eight years of its existence
it gave the principal oratorio classics, including the
'Creation,' 'Messiah,' and 'Elijah.' It was succeeded by
the Oratorio Society, which persevered, under the conductorship
of Hans Balatka, until the great fire. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
the fire it was revived, but in 1873 its library and effects
were again burned and further attempts to continue
it were unavailing. The summer of 1872 saw the
organization of the Apollo Club, which is to-day the
only society of importance in Chicago devoted to the
cultivation of oratorio music. There is also a Chicago
Musical Art Society patterned after the Musical Art
Society of New York and doing similar work. These
are the chief agencies for the cultivation of choral music
in Chicago, apart from the multitude of German
societies to which we have already alluded.</p>

<p>San Francisco had an oratorio society, organized by
Rudolph Herold, as early as 1860, and soon afterward
a Handel and Haydn Society entered the field. The
fact that these societies received support during several
years of competitive existence speaks well for the state
of musical cultivation in San Francisco at that date.
And certainly the city has not deteriorated musically
since then, if we may judge from the number of choral
societies now active there.</p>

<p>The most notable of these is the Loring Club, a male
chorus, founded in 1876, which gives concerts of unusual
artistic excellence. Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland—in
fact all the coast cities—are wide-awake and progressive
musical centres and possess efficient organizations
devoted to church work. It would be impossible
to note all of them. Indeed, the compass of a
bulky volume would scarcely inclose reference to all
the choral societies at present active in the United
States. There is scarcely a community in the land
which does not possess one or more such societies,
ranging in character from church choirs to the most
pretentious of choral organizations. Many of them,
especially in such cities as Baltimore, Washington, New
Orleans, Richmond, Louisville, Dallas, Denver, and
Kansas City, compare favorably with the more widely
known societies of New York, Boston, and Chicago.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
We must also advert again to the work of the German
singing societies, which flourish in practically every
city in the country, and to the less widespread activities
of the Scandinavian singing societies in such centres
as Lindsborg, Kansas. These supplement splendidly
the work of the native American societies, which,
to tell the truth, are more exclusively devoted to the
classics of sacred music than is good for their æsthetic
health. Altogether the cultivation of choral music is
carried on most vigorously throughout the length and
breadth of America. It must be admitted that, except
in certain circumscribed localities—Massachusetts, for
example—it has not yet struck root among the people.
It is still carried on chiefly by social coteries, by
churches, by artistic circles, by people with aspirations.
Americans do not get together and sing from an inward
urge to sing, as do the Germans and other people implanted
in our midst. Possibly that will come with the
racial homogeneity which this great crucible of a country
is striving to bring forth. In the meantime, everything
that an eager, ambitious, and optimistic people
can do to overcome its musical handicaps is now being
done by the people of America and the multiplicity
and activity of its choral organizations are symptomatic
of the energy of its endeavor.</p>

<p>In the meantime the only choral organization in the
American continent that can compare with the premier
European ensembles has been developed in Canada.
The fact is not without its significance. The Toronto
Mendelssohn Choir, to which we refer, stands out among
American choirs even more prominently than does the
Boston Symphony Orchestra among American orchestras,
and its marked preëminence has been acknowledged
without a dissentient voice by the whole body of
critical opinion in this country. It was founded in 1894
by Sir Edmund Walker, Dr. A. S. Vogt, Dr. Harold
Clark and Messrs. W. E. Rundle, W. H. Elliott, A. E.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
Huestis, and T. Harold Mason, and since the beginning
it has been under the conductorship of Dr. Vogt. The
general policy of the Toronto Choir is the study and
performance of works concerning practically the whole
range of choral composition, including all forms of
<em>a cappella</em> work, operatic excerpts, standard oratorios,
cantatas and lesser forms. Among the more important
works performed by the choir may be mentioned
Brahms' 'German Requiem,' Verdi's 'Manzoni Requiem,'
Bach's 'B Minor Mass,' Wolf-Ferrari's 'The New Life,'
Elgar's 'King Olaf,' 'Caractacus' and 'The Music Makers,'
Pierné's 'The Children's Crusade' and Coleridge-Taylor's
'Hiawatha' and 'A Tale of Old Japan.' Included
also in the repertory of the choir are smaller works by
Palestrina, Lotti, Elgar, Hugo Wolf, Granville Bantock,
Percy Pitt, Max Reger, Tschaikowsky, Moussorgsky,
Sibelius, Rachmaninoff, Gretchaninoff, Brahms, Richard
Strauss, Nowowiejski, and others. Besides its annual
cycle of five festival performances at home the
Toronto Choir has made frequent visits to the more
important musical centres of the United States. It has
given three concerts in Chicago, two in Cleveland, seven
in Buffalo, four in New York, and one in Boston.</p>

<p>As indicating the impression made by this organization
on the centres of musical culture in the United
States we may quote the following from Philip Hale's
criticism of its first performance in Boston: 'It is not
too much to say that its performance was a revelation
to even those who heard the celebrated choruses of this
country and in European cities. Other choruses may
show a high degree of technical perfection; they may be
conspicuous for decisive attack, perfect intonation, unvarying
precision, fleetness in rapid passages, the management
of breath or distribution of singers that insures
musical and rhetorical phrasing. The Mendelssohn
Choir is thus conspicuous, but it has other qualities
that are rare in choirs even for a small and carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
selected number. This choir of Toronto is remarkable
for exquisite tonal quality. In piano passages the tone
is as though disembodied. There is no thought of
massed singers or of any individual singer. The vigor
of these singers never approached coarseness, and in
fortissimos that were "as the voice of many waters"
there was always the suggestion of reserve force, so that
there was beauty in strength. There were delicate
nuances in the performance, sudden and surprising contrasts
without disturbance in rhythm and without loss
in purity of intonation. These nuances and contrasts
were apparently spontaneous.' H. T. Parker wrote on
the same occasion: 'In our musical generation Boston
has heard no such choral singing as that of the Mendelssohn
Choir in Symphony Hall, last evening, and
applauded no choral conductor of such ability as its
leader, Dr. Vogt. Now, whether the singers be one or
two hundred, a beautiful tone, an expressive tone, a
varied tone, is the sum and the substance, the beginning
and the end of musical impartment. No choir, no
choral conductor, has so mastered these secrets or gone
so far in high and various attainment in them as Dr.
Vogt and these Torontans. It seems almost pedagogical,
before these higher achievements of the Mendelssohn
Choir, to rehearse the technical skill of the choristers
and their conductor—their fidelity to the true pitch,
their decisiveness of attack, their precision of utterance,
their separate and collective command of vocal technique,
their sense of pace and rhythm. Like unanimity
and a unique sensitiveness equally distinguished the
singing of the choir on its expressive, its poetizing, its
dramatizing side.'</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>One is frequently impelled to wonder at the peculiar
trait of human psychology which leads people to gather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
together for the celebration of festivals. We do not
allude here to national festivals, or even local festivals,
in honor of some historic event or personage. We have
in mind such apparently motiveless gatherings as the
majority of music festivals. Some of them, of course,
have a very definite purpose, and some, such as the
Bayreuth Festival and the Mozart Festival at Salzburg,
have a very obvious motive. But most of them seem
to have no other <em>raison d'être</em> than the instinctive desire
of a number of people to gather into a crowd and
make a big noise. Festivals of this sort are extraordinarily
common in America. It is difficult to say
whether the amount of labor involved in the organization
of them could not be more profitably expended.
Undoubtedly in territories where musical culture is as
yet a delicate, doubtful growth they furnish a decided
stimulation. To borrow a phrase from the expressive
American slang, they are excellent contrivances for
'whooping things up.' But in a deeper sense they seem
in the main rather futile. We may instance the case
of the Worcester Festival to which we have already
alluded. It has been held annually for fifty-six years
and each year it has been very finely planned and
carried out. Each year also it has cost much money.
Yet during that time it has not brought into the light
a single new composer, new singer or new instrumentalist;
nor has it made Worcester and its environs
any more musical than they have always been. Like
most of its kind it is merely an inflated concert and
the value of inflated concerts at stated intervals is
at least open to discussion.</p>

<p>These festivals are peculiarly American and seem to
have grown out of the old musical conventions so dear
to the hearts of the psalm-singing New Englanders.
As far as we can discover, the first musical convention
was instituted at Montpelier, Vermont, by Elijah K.
Prouty and Moses Elia Cheney, both singing-school instructors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
It seems to have been a combination of
concert and musical debate. This was in 1839. Later
conventions were held at Newberry, Windsor, Woodstock,
Middlebury, and elsewhere in the Green Mountain
state. In 1848 Chicago had a musical convention,
held at the First Baptist Church, and another four
years later under the direction of William Bradbury.
Rochester (N. Y.), New York, Richmond, Washington,
Quincy (Ill.), Jacksonville (Ill.), and North Reading
(Mass.) took up the movement in turn under the direction
of George F. Root. All these conventions were
purely educational in character and were concerned
chiefly with the art of teaching music.</p>

<p>The Worcester Festival, when it started in 1858, was
a convention of the same sort, with 'lectures upon the
voice; the different styles of church music, ancient and
modern; the philosophy of scales, harmony, etc., with
singing by the whole class and by select voices; solos
by members of the convention and ladies and gentlemen
from abroad.' But the promoters of the project—Edward
Hamilton and Benjamin F. Baker—hoped
that at no distant day it might be possible 'to achieve
the performance of the oratorios and other grand
works of Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven.' This
purpose has been gradually achieved as the educational
features of the festival have been dropped. Carl Zerrahn
was chief conductor of the festival from 1866
to 1897 and was assisted at various times by W. O.
Perkins, George F. Root, Dudley Buck, Victor Herbert,
Franz Kneisel, and others. His successors have been
George W. Chadwick, Wallace Goodrich, and Arthur
Mees, in the order named.</p>

<p>The next festival of importance was the May festival
of Cincinnati, started by Theodore Thomas in 1873.
Thomas had a peculiar penchant for festivals. Quite
probably they were of some value in stirring up interest
in choral singing throughout the West. The prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
of going to the city every two years and participating
in a big musical jamboree undoubtedly had the
effect of stimulating choral societies in the smaller
towns. Since 1873 the Cincinnati May Festival has been
held regularly under the conductorship of Dr. Otto
Singer, Arthur Mees, Frank Van der Stucken, and
others. For several years, starting in 1881, the city
also held annual opera festivals.</p>

<p>To follow the spread of the festival epidemic from
coast to coast would be impossible. Nearly every city
and town in the country has at one time or other been
infected. With some of them it has become chronic.
Boston had it for a time. New York and Chicago
later caught it from Theodore Thomas, but recovered
quickly. We may also mention the peace jubilees
of Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore, which were a particularly
virulent form of the trouble. In Maine there
have been regular festivals for eighteen years, with
centres in Bangor and Portland. They are very big
and well-conducted affairs, with a mammoth chorus,
a large orchestra and soloists of international reputation.
Similar in type are the South Atlantic States
musical festivals held at Birmingham and Spartansburg
for the last twenty years. Chicago has had a
North Shore Festival Association for six seasons. Then
there are the festivals of the North American Sängerbund,
the North Eastern Sängerbund, and the innumerable
Männergesangvereine all over the country; the
Youngstown Music Festival, the Albany Music Festival,
the festival of the Buffalo Musical Association and the
Wednesday Club of Richmond, the Hampden County
Festival, and the Kansas Farmers' Easter Festival;
festivals in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Bellingham on the
coast—a perfectly bewildering array of festivals.</p>

<p>There are, however, two festivals which stand out
from all the others by virtue of their origin and the
nature of their activities. The older of these is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
Norfolk Festival of the Litchfield County Choral Union,
which has now (1914) completed its twenty-eighth season.
This is not a drummed-up affair. It is a perfectly
natural outgrowth of the numerous old singing
societies with which Litchfield county was dotted in
the psalm-singing days; it is in the best sense a product
of the soil. The Litchfield County Choral Union grew
out of the association of neighboring small ensembles
for the occasional production of large choral works in
a manner which none of them individually could accomplish
in an effective manner. The purpose was a
very useful one and it has had the effect of raising
materially the standard of the choral work among the
small societies composing the union. The Norfolk
Festival itself, which is a comparatively recent institution,
owes most of its present value to the efforts of
Robbins Battell, the founder of the professorship of
music at Yale, and more specially to the generosity and
artistic idealism of Carl Stoeckel, who was, during Mr.
Battell's lifetime, his secretary and aid. Mr. Stoeckel,
as Mr. Battell's successor, has backed the festival with
unstinted liberality. He has enabled it to bring before
the public new works of famous as well as little known
contemporary composers—particularly American—giving
substantial cash prizes for the best new American
compositions. He has placed at the disposal of the
Litchfield County Choral Union a meeting place in
ideal surroundings, modestly termed the 'Music Shed,'
and he has brought to the support of the chorus for
each festival an orchestra recruited from the best New
York and Boston organizations, as well as an array of
distinguished soloists. To secure the best possible performance
of new works produced at the festival he
has spared neither trouble nor expense, as may be instanced
by the fact that he brought Jean Sibelius to
America to conduct his own compositions. The value
of these festivals to all the choral societies and church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
choirs composing the Litchfield County Union is obvious,
but they have a still wider and greater value in
introducing to the world the creations of native American
composers and in holding up an example of fine
artistic idealism which cannot be without its influence
on the soul of the nation.</p>

<p>Of peculiar interest is the MacDowell Festival, held
annually since 1910 at Peterborough, N. H., under the
auspices of the MacDowell Memorial Association. It
is a fact that Edward MacDowell did some of his best
and most characteristic work—the Norse and Keltic
sonatas, the New England Idyls and Fireside Tales,
and many songs and choruses—in a log cabin on his
farm at Peterborough, 'surrounded by enormous pines
facing through a lovely vista Monadnock and the setting
sun.' Realizing the value to a creative artist of
such inspiring surroundings, he conceived the idea of
bequeathing the place as a centre for artists seeking
congenial conditions for work and rest. After his
death the property was transferred by Mrs. MacDowell
to the MacDowell Memorial Association. To quote the
language of the deed of gift, 'it is expressly and especially
desired that this home of Edward MacDowell
shall be a centre of interest to artists working in varied
fields, who, being there brought into contact, may learn
to appreciate fully the fundamental unity of the separate
arts. That in it the individual artist may gain a
sympathetic attitude toward the works of artists in fields
other than that in which such artist tries to embody the
beautiful by recognizing that each part has a special
function just so far as it has gained a special medium of
expression.'</p>

<p>It is obvious that the beneficent influence of the MacDowell
bequest is not confined to music, but it is natural
under the circumstances that music should be the main
beneficiary. Consequently the MacDowell Festival,
which is a sort of annual get-together party, is predominantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
a musical event, though the drama and the dance
have their share in it. It is valuable primarily as the
free expression of æsthetic aspiration unshackled by
the deadening fetters of commercialism; and secondarily
as a reasonably good opportunity for the American
composer to obtain a public hearing. If its intent
is finer than its accomplishment that is a fault unfortunately
only too common to idealistic enterprises.
Locally it accomplishes something of practical artistic
value by supporting the MacDowell Choral Club (75
voices) and the MacDowell Choir of Nashua (100
voices), both under the leadership of Eusebius Godfrey
Hood, and undoubtedly it exercises a stimulating effect
upon those who participate in it.</p>

<p>One cannot omit here a notice of the pageant movement
which has grown to quite striking proportions in
America within the past few years and which its leading
promoters designate as the most significant feature of
our present artistic development. The term pageant
is not particularly definitive. As applied to certain
mediæval entertainments it was sufficiently explicit,
but being a convenient and picturesque word it has
been borrowed somewhat freely and indiscriminately
of recent years. The beginning of the modern pageant
occurred in England in 1905 and its father was Sir Gilbert
Parker. It is a sort of <em>tableau vivant</em>, recreating
for a few hours some especially picturesque period of
the country's history. The Elizabethan period seems
to be preferred. Music enters into it only incidentally.
Boston was the first American city to adopt the idea.
This was in 1908. Quebec followed soon afterward and
Philadelphia staged an elaborate pageant in 1912. All
these were modelled after the English type.</p>

<p>In the meantime some Americans, notably William
Chauncy Langdon and Arthur Farwell, had been evolving
an idea to which they applied the convenient name
of pageant but which is fundamentally different from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
the English type and its imitators. Briefly, the new
pageant is a community drama; it is a drama with the
place for its hero and the development of the community
for its plot. In this novel type of drama the individual
is entirely submerged and the historical incidents are
chosen rather for their symbolical value than for their
intrinsic interest. The spirit informing the history of the
community is the dominant theme. Out of this idea, it
is claimed, there is being developed a new art-form representatively
American and interpretative of the American
spirit. The first pageant embodying the community
idea was written by William Chauncy Langdon for
Thetford, Vt., in 1911. Some of the music was composed
by James T. Sleeper, but most of it was adapted.
The pageant of St. Johnsbury, Vt., also written by Mr.
Langdon, followed in 1912. Brookes C. Peters, a local
man, composed most of the music for it. Then came the
pageant of Meriden, N. H., in 1913, in which Mr. Langdon
and Arthur Farwell collaborated and which was
the first pageant composed as a musical art form complete.
Mr. Farwell brought to this work a large enthusiasm
for the idea and an ardent faith in its possibilities,
and he has since taken a very conspicuous part
in its development. The pageant of Darien, Conn., in
1913, composed by him to the book of Mr. Langdon,
shows considerable progress in the evolution of the
pageant as a distinct art-form. Another step in advance
was taken by the pageant of Cape Cod in 1914,
written by Mr. Langdon with music by Daniel Gregory
Mason. The elaborate pageant and masque of St. Louis
in 1914 was of a somewhat different order and resembled
more closely the English type. The music of the
masque was composed by Frederick S. Converse, and,
being conceived as an independent art unit rather than
as incidental music, may be regarded as a new departure
in the 'masque' rather than a development of the
pageant-form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>Regarding the musical side of this and other pageants
Mr. Langdon says in a letter to the writer: 'So far as
I know in no English pageant has there been any attempt
to recognize the pageant as a new musical art-form
in itself and to develop the music as an art-unit,
comparable to the sonata, symphony, or opera. The
music has all been incidental music, though often filling
quite thoroughly all openings for anything of the kind.
Herewith much original composing has been done, and
some of it at least very fine composing. The formative
idea, or precedent I almost call it, is to be found in the
chorus of the Greek drama set to music. So, too, the
music written for the Philadelphia pageant of 1912 is
of the same type, as that pageant itself was modelled
after the English type quite closely rather than following
the American departures. But thus far, so far as I
know, my pageants are the only ones that regard the
pageant as a musical as well as dramatic art-form and
seek to work out its development as such.' Certainly
the new pageant is one of the most interesting developments
in American art, and it is especially interesting
in view of the fact that it is a distinctly American idea
particularly well calculated, one would think, to be a
vehicle for the expression of the American spirit. So
far, of course, it is largely an experiment and its history
lies rather in the future than in the past. Its susceptibility
to national application favors its possibilities considerably.</p>

<p>The lack of such susceptibility lessens the importance
of many other local and very characteristic art developments.
The most interesting of these are the Grove
Plays, or Midsummer High Jinks of the Bohemian Club
of San Francisco, which are briefly an expression in
drama and music of the spirit of joy. Climate, locale
and a body of artists with the sort of traditions indicated
by their club name, combine to give these affairs
their characteristic flavor, and it is doubtful if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
could be imitated successfully under different conditions.
But it would seem that similar attempts at local
expression, whatever form they may take, are likely to
become common in America in the future, and serve
as valuable and much-needed stimulants to the creation
of a worthy native art.</p>

<p>There seems to be general agreement among students
of American music that we are entering upon a national
era. That we did not attain this stage long before has
generally been laid to the inadequacy of our educational
system in music. A less apparent yet more rational
statement would be that our educational equipment,
growing with the increasing culture of the people
and adapting itself to their timely needs and developing
comprehension, was the kind most desirable. A
'mugwump' was defined by General Horace Porter as
'a man educated beyond his ability.' Had a European
system of musical education, however theoretically
ideal, been imposed on young America when necessarily
occupied with material problems, we might now
be a nation of musical mugwumps, smugly satisfied
with ourselves, and incapable of original achievement.</p>

<p>If it be granted, then, that musical culture is conditioned,
in kind and degree, upon the character of
the people concerned, then the colonization of our
country becomes a subject of prime importance, affording,
indeed, the best logical method, in conjunction
with a general chronological order, for discussing the
present subject.</p>

<p>The various colonies which were planted on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
eastern shores developed by permeating in successive
waves of immigration New York, northern Ohio, Indiana
and Illinois, and Michigan and Wisconsin; thence
the lines became divergent, broadening through the
trans-Mississippi plains until, emerging on the Pacific,
they embrace the entire coast, from Seattle to Los
Angeles. While the original spirit has been greatly
tempered in the course of this progress, its distinctive
character still remains—a pale tinge of Puritanism, as
it were, which colors every expression of life, and
which can be traced on the sociological map of the
United States by a narrowing belt of ever-deepening
hue, back to its undiluted source: the all-pervasive
theocracy of colonial New England.</p>

<p>From the time when this religious influence began to
reach beyond its original boundaries, it met and amalgamated,
in a social though not sectarian sense, with
Presbyterianism, a kindred spirit which, somewhat
later than Puritanism, came to America, largely from
Scotland, and took root in almost all the colonies from
New York to the Carolinas. The 'blue laws' of Connecticut,
so repressive of the graces of life, of love and
laughter and music, found their counterpart in the
Westminster Catechism, wherein the 'moral law,' that
is, the regulation of social relations, is said to be 'summarily
comprehended in the Ten Commandments,' the
first four of which are specifically religious.</p>

<p>Religion being the dominant factor in this stream
of social influence which flowed through America, and
the Bible standing as the chief and final authority on
all matters of life, music, the ever-willing handmaid of
every human institution asking her assistance, was
naturally drafted into the exclusive service of the
church. The first singing books were psalm books; the
first singing schools were organized for the purpose of
the instruction and training of church congregations
and church choirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Private instruction in music was unknown for more
than a century after the settlement of the country. In
1673 the British Commissioner for the Plantations reported
that there were no 'musicians by trade' in the
United States. Indeed, it was not until 1730 that an
advertisement appears of a music teacher. In that
year a newspaper in Charleston, S. C., printed a notice
that John Salter was teaching music in a young ladies'
boarding school conducted by his wife.</p>

<p>It is true that some of the psalm-books contained
hints for singing, but these were either too obvious or
too vague to be of practical value. Thus in the 1698
edition of the 'Bay Psalm-Book' (the work, first published
in 1640, ran through seventy editions) there is
this general direction: 'First, observe how many note-compass
the tune is next the place of your first note,
and how many notes above and below that, so as you
may begin the tune of your first note, as the rest may
be sung in the compass of your and the people's voices,
without Squeaking above or Grumbling below.'</p>

<p>As we have seen (in Chapter II), the first books of
psalmody pretending to be works of instruction were
those of the Rev. John Tufts, of Newbury, Mass., published
in 1712 and 1714, and that of the Rev. Thomas
Walter, of Roxbury, Mass., published in 1721. Largely
as a result of Tufts' and Walter's publications, singing
schools to teach the reading of psalm-tunes by sight
began to be established in New England, although not
without strenuous opposition.</p>

<p>In 1723 the Rev. Thomas Symmes, of Bradford, Mass.,
published a 'joco-serious dialogue concerning regular
singing,' which bore the title '<em>Utile Dulci</em>.' In this he
presents and answers prevalent objections to singing by
note, among which the following are significant of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
ignorance, intolerance and pruriency of the 'unco guid'
of that day:</p>

<p>'5. That it is <em>Quakerish</em> and <em>Popish</em>, and introductive
of <em>instrumental</em> musick.</p>

<p>'6. That the names given to the notes are <em>bawdy</em>,
yea <em>blasphemous</em>.'</p>

<p>The second stimulus to musical education in America
was imparted by various American reprints of two
English books on psalmody: W. Tansur's collection,
'The Royal Melody Complete,' published in 1754, and
Aaron Williams' 'The New Universal Psalmodist,' published
in 1763. The prevalent taste in England for
musical rococo, such as florid and meaningless 'fuguing
choruses,' was thus transplanted to the colonies, where
it made a deep impression which was harder to remove
and persisted longer than in the mother country.</p>

<p>The most conservative strain of English musical culture,
that associated with the Anglican church, existed
also in America, awaiting its turn to reign, when growth
in general culture and artistic capacity should cause
the people to tire of the ingratiating but inconsequential
music which held sway. Its exponent was William
Tuckey, an English musician of high training and culture,
who came to New York in 1753 and made an
earnest attempt to educate the colonial people in an
appreciation of the best church music. His career as
teacher as well as organist and composer has already
been touched upon in these pages (see Chap. II).
Tuckey called himself 'Professor of the Theory and
Practice of Vocal Music,' and the part he played in the
musical education of New York and Philadelphia fully
justifies the assertion that he was the first teacher in
America worthy of the title. His pupils became prominent
in all movements of their respective cities for the
elevation of not only sacred but secular music to the
best standards of Europe.</p>

<p>Already there was the leaven of German influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
working for the betterment of music in America. In
1741 Moravian Brethren in their community at Bethlehem,
Pa., a little town which has retained to the
present day the distinction of being a home of music
of the highest order, had established singing schools.
Ten years later they formed, in connection with these,
an orchestra for the rendition of secular as well as
sacred music. In the correspondence of the time, lovers
of their country, men who, like Samuel Adams, of Boston,
had begun to think nationally and who shortly
afterward were to become patriots of the Revolution,
put on record their gratification at this important contribution
to American culture.</p>

<p>A taste for good music and a desire to inculcate it
were also developing in Philadelphia and Baltimore,
as shown by records of the time. In 1764 the vestry of
St. Peter's and Christ Church in the prosperous city
founded by William Penn extended a vote of thanks to
two of its most cultured and public-spirited citizens,
William Young and Francis Hopkinson (who was soon
to achieve distinction as a poet and patriot of the
Revolution), for instructing the children of the church
in psalmody. In 1765, at St. Anne's Church, Baltimore,
Hugh Maguire, probably the organist, established a
singing school, for use in which he published 'a new
version of the psalms, with all the tunes, both of particular
and common measure.' He announced that he
would teach singing at their homes to young ladies
who played the spinet, his remuneration to be fifteen
shillings a quarter and an entrance fee of one dollar.</p>

<p>Returning to New England, we find in William Billings,
the 'great Yankee singing-master,' the most important
musical influence of the time. The date of publication
of his original compositions, 1770, marks an era
in American music. By this time the old psalm-tunes
in use, only four in number, were worn to death, and
the new tunes, having been composed in the novel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
fuguing style of the English compositions, became instantly
popular with the singing schools, which Billings
was energetic in organizing and conducting. The
most notable of these, that at Stoughton, Mass., is elsewhere
described, as well as the general activities of
Billings and other teachers of the same general school.</p>

<p>In the circle of musical development of which Philadelphia
was the centre, Andrew Adgate of that city
was the leading spirit. In 1784 he established an 'Institution
for the Encouragement of Church Music' supported
by subscription and governed by trustees. So
fervent was Adgate in the cause of 'music for the people'
that, as conductor of the institution, he organized
'public singings,' which became so popular that within
a year the trustees, objecting to 'the indiscriminate assemblage'
of the general public, restricted admission to
subscribers. Adgate thereupon resigned his position
and established a free school, 'Adgate's Institution for
diffusing more generally the knowledge of vocal music.'
It is significant of the public spirit of the 'cradle
of independence' that he found a number of influential
men willing to act as trustees of the new organization.
The splendid institution which is now the University
of Pennsylvania opened its doors to the new enterprise.
Inviting requests to join these free classes, Adgate announced:
'The more there are who make this application
and the sooner they make it, the more acceptable
will it be to the trustees and the teacher.'</p>

<p>Adgate's Institution had a marked influence in Philadelphia
in the development of musical appreciation,
which is an essential precedent in any community of the
practical cultivation of the art. Foreign music teachers
after trying vainly in other places, such as New York,
for something like remunerative recognition, finally
found it in the city whose civic spirit had been broadened
by Adgate to include artistic as well as material
progress. Among these may be mentioned William<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Tuckey, already noted; the English musician, Rayner
Taylor, who came to America in 1792; and Filippo
Trajetta, a Venetian, the son of the noted composer
Tomaso Trajetta. Filippo was trained by the best masters,
notably Piccini; entering the revolutionary army
of Italy, he was captured by the royalists, but, escaping,
fled to America, arriving in Boston in 1799, where he
taught singing. He toured through the South as a theatrical
manager, and finally settled in Philadelphia,
teaching and composing music ('Washington's Dead
March' being his most popular composition) until his
death at the age of seventy-eight in 1854. He published
'Rudiments of the Art of Singing' as a text-book for
the 'American Conservatorio,' an institution established
in Philadelphia by his pupil, Uri K. Hill; in this he
advocated the Italian system of <em>solfeggio</em> to supersede
the 'defective sol-fa-ing' in universal use in America.</p>

<p>In New England, more particularly Boston, we find
that the foreign influence was making itself felt in
music through 'The Massachusetts Compiler,' a work
which embodied something of the theory of music as
given in the works of German, French, and English authorities.
The introduction of this element was probably
due to Hans Gram, the German organist at Brattle
Church, Boston, who, with Oliver Holden and Samuel
Holyoke, published the work in 1795. To Gottlieb
Graupner, another German, was mainly due the foreign
influence which caused Boston to become for half
a century the leading city of the country in musical
influence. The 'Philharmonic Society,' which was
formed by Graupner and his associates in 1810, prepared
the way for the Handel and Haydn Society,
founded in 1815, which not only educated Boston and
New England in musical appreciation, but had a formative
influence on the taste of the entire country.</p>

<p>English talent conjoined at Boston with German in
this educational work. Dr. G. J. Jackson, an English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
musician of the order of William Tuckey and Rayner
Taylor—indeed, he was Taylor's schoolmate—had
come to America in 1796, and taught music at Norfolk
and Alexandria, Va., and Baltimore, Philadelphia, and
New York. In his northward progress he arrived in
Boston in 1812, and became organist successively of
the Brattle Street Church, King's Chapel, Trinity
Church, and St. Paul's Church. He was the leading
choirmaster of his day, teaching the English method
of chanting, and was employed as music teacher by the
first families. He published a book of chants, anthems,
etc., and contributed original compositions to 'The
Churchman's Choral Companion,' published in New
York in 1808 by the Rev. William Smith. His friend
Rayner Taylor was also represented in the collection.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A singing club, more social than serious in its purpose,
had been formed at Harvard in 1786. In 1808 a
novel institution, the 'Pierean Sodality,' was established
at the college. This was a singing fraternity, the members
of which were linked together by a common interest
in music. The Sodality was the germ of the present
Department of Music in Harvard University. Out
of it there arose in 1837 the 'Harvard Musical Association,'
composed of alumni of the college who had been
members of the Sodality. The report of the committee
on organization admirably described the fraternal function
of music and stated the fashion in which this was
to be realized by the new association:</p>

<p>'Nothing unites men more than music. It makes
brothers of strangers; it makes the most diffident feel
at home; the most shy and suspicious it renders frank
and full of trust; it overflows the rocks of separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
between us; it comes up like a full tide beneath us, and
opens a free intercourse of hearts.</p>

<p>'We propose, then, to form an association which shall
meet here annually on commencement day: if for nothing
more, at least to exchange salutations and review
recollections, and feel the common bond of music and
old scenes....</p>

<p>'But the ultimate object proposed is the advancement
of the cause of music, particularly in this university.
We would have it regarded as an important object of
attention within its walls, as something which sooner
or later must hold its place in every liberal system of
education; and that place not accidental or a stolen
one, but formally recognized. We that love music feel
that it is worthy of its professorship, as well as any
other science.'</p>

<p>As we shall see later this high purpose was fulfilled
in the establishment of a Department of Music in Harvard
on an equal basis with the other departments.
The association stated that one of its objects was to
collect a musical library, and another to promote the
production of great symphonies. This program was
greatly extended in the course of the existence of the
association; chamber concerts, hitherto unknown in
Boston, were given in the winter under the leadership
of such artists as Herwig and Hohnstock. These concerts
led in 1849 to the organization of the Mendelssohn
Quintet Club for the exclusive cultivation of chamber
music. In 1852, with the moral backing of the association,
J. S. Dwight, one of its leading spirits, established
'Dwight's Journal of Music,' a periodical of the highest
aim and most authoritative character. Its publication
ceased in 1881.</p>

<p>The 'Handel Society of Dartmouth College,' discussed
in another connection, had a fate unworthy of its
high character and sadly significant of the low state of
musical appreciation in the smaller colleges of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
times, and in the 'common people' from which class
their students were chiefly drawn. It dwindled and died
for lack of recruits. Pity it is that some loyal patron
of the college had not provided for the perpetuation of
the society, if only as a memorial of Dartmouth's chief
glory, even surpassing that of having trained in some
measure the classic rhetoric and Olympian accents of
the greatest of American orators. Our democracy
alone, unaided by college culture, produced Lincoln, in
most minds the rival of Webster in perfect phrase and
his superior in heart-moving utterance, if not in ear-entrancing
tone. It has not yet brought forth the compeers
of these in music, since education is required to
supply the nurturing musical environment found
abroad but hitherto lacking in American life. Had
music been permanently established as a part of the
curriculum of Dartmouth alone, not to speak of the
other colleges, a few young men with a native taste
for it would undoubtedly have been found in every
class and these would have cherished and transmitted
the sacred fire with increasing ardor until the inevitable
time arrived when native genius would be kindled into
immortal flame.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>A new order of native-born music teachers, those
who pursued European methods in their instruction,
was now arising. The chief of this class was Lowell
Mason. Mason was born at Medfield, Mass., and spent
his youth and early manhood in Savannah, Ga., where
he was engaged in business. A music-lover from early
childhood, he carried to the South the psalmody of
New England, but, becoming master of a church choir,
he felt the inadequacy of existing collections of church
music and, with the valuable assistance of a local music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
teacher, Mr. Abel, prepared a new one suited to his
needs.</p>

<p>He came to Boston seeking a publisher and found it
in the Handel and Haydn Society, which, in 1822, not
only published the collection but gave the society's
name to it. It met with great success, running through
many editions. In 1826 its compiler delivered a series
of lectures in Boston churches on church music which
attracted such favorable attention that he was induced
to make his home in the city. In time he became president
of the Handel and Haydn Society, and, when the
Boston Academy of Music was established, largely
through his efforts, he was put in charge of it.</p>

<p>At this period began a movement to reform radically
our entire system of school instruction, and the moment
was propitious for the introduction of music in
the public schools, a purpose upon which Mr. Mason
had set his heart. In 1830 William C. Woodbridge delivered
before the American Institute of Instruction in
Boston an address on 'Vocal Music as a Branch of Common
Education,' illustrated by Mason's pupils, in which
the lecturer, recently returned from Europe, warmly
advocated the cultivation of music as an essential element
of American, as it was of foreign life. One sentence
of his lecture is startling to us of the present
generation in its inferential revelation of the primitive
nature of juvenile instruction in the United States as
late as 1830. Mr. Woodbridge, speaking of music being
'the property of the people' in Germany and Switzerland,
heard in field and factory, and in gatherings
for pleasure no less than in assemblies for worship,
added: 'But we were touched to the heart when we
heard its cheering animating strains issuing from the
walls of a schoolroom.'</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbridge was an enthusiast over the Pestalozzian
method as applied to instruction in music. He
not only collected all the literature he could on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
subject, but even translated the more important works
and turned over the entire material to Mr. Mason. This
wise teacher experimented first with the method before
adopting it. The success of the trial made him an ardent
supporter of the new system of instruction, which
completely overthrew the old custom of starting the
pupil off with a complete tune and correcting defects
as these manifested themselves. The Pestalozzian
method is truly the natural one, building up, instead
of patching up. This will be seen by examining its
principles:</p>


<div class="block1 p11">
<p class="hang"><span style="padding-right: 0.2em;">1.</span> To teach sounds before signs (have the pupil learn notes
orally first).</p>

<p class="hang"><span style="padding-right: 0.2em;">2.</span> To lead the pupil to observe and execute differences in
sound, instead of explaining these to him, i. e., to make him
active instead of passive in learning.</p>

<p class="hang"><span style="padding-right: 0.2em;">3.</span> To teach one thing at a time—rhythm, melody, expression—instead
of a selection embodying all these elements.</p>

<p class="hang"><span style="padding-right: 0.2em;">4.</span> To have the pupil master each step by practice before
passing to the next.</p>

<p class="hang"><span style="padding-right: 0.2em;">5.</span> To explain principles after practice (the inductive
method).</p>

<p class="hang"><span style="padding-right: 0.2em;">6.</span> Analysis and practice of articulation of speech in order
to use it in song.</p>
 </div>

<p>To apply this revolutionary method to teaching music
was the central purpose of the establishment of the
Boston Academy of Music. It had a useful career during
the fourteen years of its existence. Mr. Mason, like
Mr. Adgate, of Philadelphia, believed in 'music for the
people,' and his generosity in extending this without
considering material profit kept the institution in constant
need of funds until it gave up the struggle and
closed its doors in 1847.</p>

<p>The Academy was more than a New England institution:
it was a national one, in that music teachers
in every part of the country wrote to it for guidance
in their work. And it left behind it the finest of mmorials,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
the establishment in Boston, and, through Boston's
example, all over the nation, of music in the
public schools, not merely as a relief from other
studies, but as a study itself. This innovation was made
by the city fathers of Boston in 1837, after a trial of
the propositions had proved successful. T. Kemper
Davis, chairman of the school committee, made a long
and learned report upon the subject which is a classic
of its kind, and as such may be read with profit by
teachers of music, particularly those in the public
schools.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Music in the public schools of New York had an
independent origin. In 1835 Darius E. Jones experimented
with the idea of forming singing classes in
the schools and teaching them without compensation.
The trial was successful, and the school board gave
him permission to continue the work provided no expense
was incurred and regular studies were not interfered
with. Music in the New York schools was not
effectively recognized by provision for compensation
until 1853. T. B. Mason, the brother of Lowell Mason,
introduced singing in the public schools of Cincinnati.
Pittsburgh began such instruction in 1840. Nathaniel
D. Gould, a music teacher and composer, claimed to
have been the first to teach singing to children in a systematic
method. From 1820 onward he organized such
classes in New England, New York, and New Jersey.</p>

<p>The recognition by municipal authority of music as
an essential element of education has been ratified in
the fullest manner by national authority. Philander
P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education,
addressing the National Education Association convened
at St. Paul, in July, 1914, asserted that music
is of more practical value than any subject of the
usual curriculum, except reading and writing, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>these studies, and physical culture and arithmetic,
forms the fundamentals in elementary education.</p>

<p>While in the later thirties colleges and universities
were not prepared to grant music a place in the academic
curriculum, they began to recognize it as an important
element of culture, and to extend to it their
patronage. In 1838 William Robyn, a professor in St.
Louis University, formed, under the auspices of the
institution, a musical society called the 'Philharmonic'
for the performance of public concerts. These were
well patronized.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The German immigration was in full force in the
forties, cities such as St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Milwaukee
becoming the homes of great numbers of this music-loving
people. In the broad sense of the term, they
formed the greatest educational influence in music that
the country had yet received. It is said that wherever
two Germans settled in America they organized themselves
into a <em>Sängerbund</em>. Tyrolese and Swiss singers
and bell-ringers began to tour the country in 1840 and
delighted Americans of every class—even now they are
popular in the Chautauqua circles. However, when,
lured by the success of the <em>jodlers</em>, really fine German
bands, such as the Steiermarkers, Gungl's band, the
Saxonia and Germania, came over in quest of American
dollars, they met with consistent failure, and were
forced to dissolve—to the great benefit of American
musical education, for the individual members generally
became teachers of instrumental music in the localities
where they were stranded. It was only by playing
dance music and popular airs that the bands met
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>with any success whatsoever. Gungl (whose 'Railroad
Galop,' an imitative composition, was the most popular
in his répertoire) wrote home to a musical journal
in Berlin that music 'lies still in the cradle here and
nourishes herself on sugar-teats.'</p>

<p>The sentimental strain in German vocal music of
the period made it more popular than German instrumental
music, in that the American palate had been
prepared for sentimentality by a saccharine sort of
psalmody and secular music which was being sprinkled
over the country by a second generation of Yankee
music teachers of the Billings order. Elijah K. Prouty
and Moses E. Cheney were leading representatives of
this class. Prouty was a peddler, singing teacher, and
piano tuner. Cheney was a leader of a church choir.
In 1839 they organized and conducted a musical 'convention'
at Montpelier, Vt., at which, with shrewd perception
of popular interest in novelty and variety, they
practised 'unusual tunes, anthems, male quartets, and
duets and solos for both sexes.' For the secular music
they used the 'Boston Glee Book and Social Choir,'
compiled by George Kingsley. In order to attract the
attendance of non-musical people, in the intervals between
performances short debates were held between
the local ministers, lawyers, and other prominent citizens.</p>

<p>In May, 1848, another musical convention was held
in Chicago, which discussed the general question of
musical education and the specific one of music in the
public schools. Four years later William B. Bradbury
led a similar but larger convention. At this convention
the 'Alpine Glee Singer,' a compilation by Bradbury,
was used for secular music, indicating the strong influence
which the elementary sentimentality of German
popular music exerted upon Americans. Sugared American
psalmody, flavored with German sentimentality,
and colored with a crudity of technique almost aboriginal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
produced that sort of musical candy which we
know as the Sunday-school song. Bradbury was a pioneer
in the composition and publication of such music,
although, to do him justice, the especially deleterious
coloring of the mixture was added by his successors,
among whom Ira D. Sankey and P. P. Bliss may be
mentioned as chief offenders. The collections of this
school of musical composers must be reckoned by thousands
in editions and millions in numbers of copies.
Bradbury alone compiled more than fifty singing books,
containing many of his own compositions. Of these collections
'The Jubilee,' published in 1857, sold 200,000
copies; 'Fresh Laurels' (1867), 1,200,000 copies; and a
series known as the 'Golden Series,' 2,000,000 copies.</p>

<p>This flood of sentimentality, completely inundating
the Sunday-school, poured into the public school, and
almost swamped the ark of juvenile education in music
which careful hands had just committed to that great
stream of popular culture. When music became recognized
as an essential element of education, it was
inevitable that the only available juvenile songs, those
of the Sunday-school, should be introduced in the public
schools. Indeed, the singing of anything in the
schools was preferable to the entire absence of song,
and so this order of music, representing, as it did, the
popular taste of the time, marks, although we are loath
to say it, an important step forward.</p>

<p>Dr. Lowell Mason was the chief assistant at an event
which marks an epoch in American musical education,
namely, the birth of the normal musical institute from
the so-called musical convention. This occurred in
1856 at North Reading, Mass., where an annual musical
convention of the usual sort was converted into a school
of a fortnight's duration for instructing its members,
particularly teachers, in both musical theory and practice.
The example was followed all over the country to
the great benefit of musical pedagogy. Associated with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Dr. Mason in this work of popularizing music was
George F. Root, who journeyed over the country conducting
conventions, lecturing, etc.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>During the second half of the nineteenth century
the teaching of music passed in large measure from
the hands of single, independent teachers into the
direction of music masters associated in institutions for
class instruction, which are generally known as conservatories,
although this term in its European signification
of a large, completely equipped and nationally
endowed school of music is misleading. Indeed, the
pretense seems to have been deliberate. Dr. Frank
Damrosch, in an address on 'The American Conservatory,'
before the Music Teachers' National Association
at Oberlin, Ohio, in 1906, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot small1">

<p>'The so-called conservatory, college, or university of music ... may
be found in every American community.... It is
usually organized by an individual whose commercial instincts
are stronger than his musical conscience, and who, banking on
the dense ignorance of the average citizen in matters of art,
offers what seems to be a great bargain in the acquisition of
musical ability in one form or another.... There are many
such schools which seemingly flourish by the glittering, if
empty, promises which they advertise. Some of them confer
degrees; ... one of the first musical doctor degrees conferred
by the director of one of these schools was on himself!'</p>
</div>

<p>While there are hundreds of conservatories of the
class described by Dr. Damrosch scattered over the
Union, a number of institutions are to be found which
rank in thoroughness and comprehensiveness of instruction
with the best European conservatories. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>have been in every instance of slow growth, the most
pretentious in chartered plans having made early and
signal failures in the province of musical education,
though some of them won success in other musical
activities. A typical example of this order is the Academy
of Music of New York, whose career is recorded in
Chapter VI.</p>

<p>The earliest American conservatory worthy of its
name is the Conservatory of Music of the Peabody Institute,
Baltimore, which was founded in 1857. Its
chief contribution to American musical education has
been the Peabody concerts, a series of eight performances
having been given annually since 1865. From
1872 to 1898 Asger Hamerick, the Danish composer, was
director. He organized an orchestra of fifty performers,
which became, under his intelligent training, a
highly efficient instrument for the rendition of the most
advanced music. The programs of his concerts were
formed of overtures, symphonies, concertos, suites, and
vocal solos. He gave especial attention to works by
American, English, and Scandinavian composers, performing
for the first time in America many notable
compositions, among them a number of his own. The
good work of the Peabody concerts, attracting, as it
has done, the respectful attention of foreign masters,
should be a matter both of encouragement and pride
to those who have the cause of American music at
heart. It points the way to high attainment in our
musical appreciation and notable achievement in native
composition.</p>

<p>The year of 1867 is notable in American musical history
for the establishment of five leading conservatories
or musical colleges: the New England Conservatory
in Boston; the Boston Conservatory; the Cincinnati
Conservatory; the Oberlin Conservatory; and the Chicago
Academy of Music, later known as the Chicago
Musical College.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>The New England Conservatory was founded by
Eben Tourjée, whom Sir George Grove, in his 'Dictionary
of Music and Musicians,' denominates the
'father of the conservatory or class system of instruction
in America.' The nature of this system and its
advantages have been well expressed by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,
who said: 'The class system has the
advantage over the private instruction of the individual
in that, by the participation of several in the same lessons
and studies, a true feeling is awakened; and in
that it promotes industry, spurs to emulation, and is a
preservative from one-sidedness of education and
taste.'</p>

<p>Dr. Tourjée, in 1851, at the age of seventeen, formed
classes at his home, Fall River, Mass., for instruction
in vocal and instrumental music. In 1859 he founded a
musical institute at East Greenwich, where he greatly
developed his method. In 1863 he visited Europe to
gain information concerning the conduct of European
conservatories, and upon the ideas thus secured he established
the Providence Conservatory of Music, and
in 1867 the New England Conservatory of Music in
Boston. For a time he conducted both schools, then
devoted himself exclusively to the latter. From its
beginning the Boston institution secured the best masters
available and gave a maximum of musical instruction
at a minimum of cost. It has sent forth over the
country thousands of accomplished pianists, organists,
and vocalists, and, what is even more pertinent to the
present subject, music teachers, trained in Tourjée's
methods. After the founder died (in 1890), Carl Faelten
acted as director, until in 1897 he founded a school
of his own for instruction in the piano. No school
of its kind stands higher in America.</p>

<p>In 1897 George W. Chadwick, the professor of harmony,
composition, and orchestration, was made director
of the New England Conservatory. For several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
years Mr. Chadwick had conducted the annual musical
festivals at Springfield and Worcester, Mass., and his
special attention was thereby directed toward great
orchestral and choral performances by the students,
whose number was mounting into the thousands. By
the generosity of patrons of the Conservatory, especially
Eben D. Jordan, president of the trustees, a large
building was erected in 1902, containing facilities for
instruction superior even to those of European conservatories,
and an auditorium, Jordan Hall, whose
large size and fine acoustic properties render it one
of the important concert halls of the country, use as
such being frequently made of it by visiting artists, to
the great advantage of the students as well as the general
public. The instrumental equipment of the conservatory
is large, the collection of organs, including
the pipe organ in Jordan Hall, which is one of the
largest in the world, being especially notable.</p>

<p>The conservatory possesses one of the best working
musical libraries in the country, a unique feature being
the choral library of the Boylston Club (founded 1872)
and its successor, the Boston Singers, which contains
many copies of manuscript treasures in European collections.
This library was a gift to the conservatory
by George L. Osgood. The Boston Public Library nearby
contains the Allen A. Brown collection of musical
books and manuscripts, which is excelled in America
only by the Congressional Library at Washington. Accordingly,
the pupils of the conservatory have at hand
every facility for acquiring a musical education which
the most ardent student could desire. It is not surprising
that among its three thousand and more students
every one of the forty-eight states of the Union is
represented, as well as a dozen foreign countries, even
distant Russia and Turkey.</p>

<p>The curriculum of the conservatory has been generally
described by Frederick W. Colburn in 'The Musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Observer' for July, 1913. Mr. Colburn, after mentioning
special features, such as the conservatory orchestra of
seventy-five members, affording the training and routine
indispensable to professional performers whose
ranks it is annually supplying, says: 'While the new is
studied, the fundamentals are not lost sight of. All
the courses have been planned to avoid turning out
narrow and one-sided specialists. The management
realizes that the professional musician has need of
very broad and very correct culture. The students listen
to lectures on the history and theory of music from
such authorities as Louis C. Elson and Wallace Goodrich.
The modern languages and English diction are
taught by experts, several of whom are authors of their
own text-books. The pianoforte instruction follows
approved methods; it shows much of the influence of
the late Carl Baermann, one of the most eminent of
the German musicians who have settled in this country.
The vocal instruction is along the lines of the old Italian
method which has formed the voices of most of
the world's great singers. The teaching of the organ
accords with the practice of the best German and
French organists. In all departments there is present
the idea of thoroughly grounding the student in the
essentials of musical art and of avoiding easy, ready-made
and get-culture-quick methods.'</p>

<p>The Boston Conservatory, second in the list of five
founded in 1867, was organized by Julius Eichberg, a
distinguished German violinist and composer, who had
been, since 1859, director of the orchestra at the Boston
Museum. This speedily won and long maintained a
high reputation, particularly for instruction in the violin,
on which subject Eichberg prepared a number of
valuable text-books.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Conservatory of Music was founded
by Clara Bauer, who still is active in its management,
having charge of the home for the female pupils. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
was the first conservatory in the country to establish
a residence department—indeed, its group of buildings
and park-like grounds give the conservatory a truly
academic aspect possessed by few institutions of its
kind that are situated in cities. Miss Bauer, however,
recognized from the beginning that the all-important
element of a conservatory was its teaching force. She
secured representative talent in the various branches of
music from the various European musical centres,
thereby securing warm approbation of the institution
from foreign musical artists and critics. The faculty
now numbers sixty members; it contains artists notable
for excellence in every branch of musical arts and
pedagogy. General cultural studies, such as dramatic
art, literature, and modern languages, are conducted
with special application to their relation to music.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Conservatory was the first to conduct
a summer music school. The sessions have been uninterrupted
since 1867. Attended largely by music teachers,
they have greatly advanced the cause of musical
education in the territory tributary to the city.</p>

<p>The Oberlin Conservatory of Music, at Oberlin, presents
so many object lessons of musical pedagogy that
it demands rather extended treatment here.</p>

<p>In the first place, the institution had a natural origin:
it was formed to teach psalmody to a religious community
and, in growing beyond this limited field by
adding one musical feature after another as the developing
taste of the people demanded, it typifies the
history of music in the nation. Secondly, the conservatory
has a proper environment. It was planted in a soil
already enriched by culture, Oberlin being the seat of
a college distinguished for progressive ideas and high
ideals, the reaction of which upon musical work is
always inspiring—indeed, is essential to the highest
achievement. Thirdly, the Oberlin Conservatory has a
proper organization. It is a social democracy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
thereby calculated to produce that free and fraternal
spirit which is the soul of art. Young men and women
meet on equal terms and there are no distinctions
among them based on wealth or nationality or even
race, Oberlin having been the first college to include
negroes among its students. Lastly, the conservatory
has a sound program and is living up to this as well as
could be expected in view of the pressure exerted on
all 'schools of the people,' to supply immediate demands.
It believes in constructive work, in learning by
doing. Thus it regards a practical knowledge of the
science of musical composition as necessary to an intelligent
appreciation of musical masterpieces, and
to this end has established a course in theory and composition
which requires four years of hard study and
assiduous practice. The class system of instruction is
the one adopted as the chief method, it being supplemented
by private instruction.</p>

<p>Dr. Florens Ziegfeld, a distinguished German pianist,
still conducts (1915) the conservatory which he founded
in Chicago—the last of the five started in 1867—under
the name of the Chicago Academy of Music, and which
is now called the Chicago Musical College. The institution
was burned out in the great fire of 1871, but
with indomitable courage Dr. Ziegfeld at once secured
new quarters and continued his classes. The course
of study was steadily enlarged until now it includes
every department of music and the principal modern
languages, the faculty being one of the strongest in the
country, comparing favorably with those of European
conservatories. By authority of the State of Illinois
the college grants music teachers' certificates and confers
musical degrees. The college is finely situated on
Michigan Boulevard, overlooking Lake Michigan and
Grant Park. It contains a concert hall seating 1,000. A
student orchestra of seventy members is maintained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
affording practical training in conducting and ensemble
playing.</p>

<p>In 1871 a conservatory of music was established in
Jacksonville, Ill., the seat of Illinois College. Its founder
was Professor W. D. Sanders, a leading Western
educator, and its first director was I. B. Poznanski, a
violinist and composer who later became instructor at
the Royal Conservatory, London. In 1903 the conservatory
was merged with the college. The Cleveland
Conservatory of Music was also founded in 1871. It
adopted the European conservatory method of instruction.</p>

<p>In 1873 Northwestern University at Evanston, Ill.,
became a co-educational institution and at once established
a 'Conservatory of Music' that began, and for
many years thereafter remained, on a low plane of instruction.
The university authorities, in the manner of
old-time monarchs, 'farmed out' to the director of the
conservatory the privilege of running the business for
a percentage of the receipts, and gave him a free hand
and full responsibility. Naturally the conservatory
was conducted in a way to produce the greatest immediate
returns.</p>

<p>In 1891 Prof. P. C. Lutkin was put in charge of the
conservatory. He insisted that the title be dropped
and that the school be made a department of the university,
directly under control of the university authorities;
and that its director should receive a full professorship
with a fixed salary, in order that educational
ideals should not be compromised by financial considerations.
These changes were authorized, and Professor
Lutkin radically revised and extended the curriculum
to make it conform to academic standards.
By 1895 a four-years course was developed, to correspond
with that of the Liberal Arts department. The
'Department of Music' then assumed the title of 'School
of Music' and became a coördinate division of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
university, like the School of Law, the School of Mines,
etc., with its own dean and faculty. Its pupils, of
course, retained all the opportunities for general culture
afforded by the college of Liberal Arts.</p>

<p>In an address delivered before the Music Teachers'
National Association at Oberlin in 1906, Professor Lutkin
said: 'The exact point where general education
should give way to the study of music is a much discussed
one, and we will not stop to consider it here,
except to say that we have placed it at the point of entrance-requirements
in the College of Liberal Arts. The
fact that the students are able to pursue advanced work
in history of music, harmony, counterpoint, analysis,
etc., is of itself a clear index as to their mental capacity,
and places them, without doubt, upon a plane of
mentality quite up to that required of college students.'
The music department of the Northwestern University
now ranks with the best conservatories in the country.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Concerts have always formed the leading element
in developing American appreciation of music. The
enthusiasm created by the festivals conducted in Cincinnati
by Theodore Thomas in the early seventies led
directly to the establishment in 1878 of the Cincinnati
College of Music by Miss Dora Nelson. The institution
was planned along the lines of European conservatories,
with a close relation to superior public performances
in the city, the patrons of which were patrons of
the college. With a fine faculty the institution has retained
to the present the high reputation it won at the
outset. Theodore Thomas was the first musical director
of the school, and among his successors is Frank
Van der Stucken.</p>

<p>Of the important Chicago schools of music the earliest
was the Chicago Conservatory, established in 1884.
Quite a typical institution is the American Conservatory
of Chicago. It was founded in 1886 by its present head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
President John J. Hattstaedt, with the assistance of several
of Chicago's music-loving citizens. Its quarters
were in Weber Hall Building, corner of Wabash Avenue
and Jackson Street, which were retained for ten
years, when the conservatory was removed to the adjoining
building—Kimball Hall, where it still remains.</p>

<p>From a small institution it has grown to be one of
America's largest schools of music, registering about
2,000 students annually. The faculty numbers seventy-five,
and contains many teachers of national reputation.
A modern and thorough curriculum includes all
branches of instrumental and vocal music, theory and
composition, dramatic art, expression, physical culture,
and modern languages. Special features are: a complete
and well-established Normal School, a student's
orchestra, a musical bureau and a carefully arranged
series of faculty and pupils' recitals.</p>

<p>In 1885 two conservatories, the American Institute of
Applied Music and the National Conservatory of Music,
were established in New York. Miss Kate S. Chittenden
was the founder of the Institute, Mrs. Jeannette
M. Thurber of the Conservatory. Both are flourishing
to-day under control of the founders and with excellent
faculties and ample musical facilities.</p>

<p>The National Conservatory, because of certain philanthropic
features, is deserving of special mention as
a type of institution which is not wholly commercial
in its ends, and which has prepared the way for a type
that is purely artistic in its purposes. It offers musical
instruction to every applicant without regard to race,
sex, or creed, the sole condition being that he shall give
proof of a natural talent for music; this instruction it
imparts without cost to those unable to pay.</p>

<p>The title of National Conservatory is formally justified
by the fact that it was chartered in 1891 by a special
act of Congress, the official home being designated
as Washington. A far better claim to the title could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
be based on the facts that names of even more than
national fame appear on the roll of its faculty from
the beginning, when such musicians as Rafael Joseffy,
Camilla Urso, and Victor Herbert were connected with
the institution, down through Dvořák's brilliant régime
to the present day.</p>

<p>The Conservatory at its outset secured experts in
special lines of music as instructors. For three years
(1892-95) Dr. Antonin Dvořák was its director. Under
his management liberal prizes were awarded for original
compositions, and the works, a symphony by Henry
Schoenefeld, a piano concerto by Joshua Phillen, a
suite for string orchestra by Frederick Bullard, and a
cantata by Horatio W. Parker, were performed in public
concert. Under the direction of the distinguished
composer the National Conservatory orchestra became
notable not only for artistic excellence, but, what pertains
more to the present subject, for the superior training
it afforded poor young men of talent, and the places
this enabled them to obtain in leading American orchestras.
This work, of course, did not cease with Dr.
Dvořák's retirement.</p>

<p>An institution incorporating in a systematic and substantial
way the public and philanthropic spirit which
has called into existence so many of our conservatories
and schools of music is the Institute of Musical Art of
the City of New York. This is the model institution
of its kind in America; and, as there is promise that its
example will be followed in other cities of the Union,
leading to the establishment of musical education on a
high and uniform plane, it deserves special notice.</p>

<p>Recognizing that schools of music, inaugurated with
fine ideals and a sound program to attain these, have
almost without exception been forced by the need of
funds to lower their standard and modify their curricula
to suit the popular demand for easy and flashy
courses, Dr. Frank Damrosch determined to found an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
institution wherein commercial considerations would
not enter. In James Loeb, a New York banker, he
found a patron of art in thorough sympathy with the
project. By a fund of a half million dollars, given in
memory of his mother, Betty Loeb, Mr. Loeb put the
splendid idea into concrete form, and in 1905 established
and endowed the Institute of Musical Art with
Dr. Damrosch as its director.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Institute is to provide thorough
and comprehensive courses in music, each of which
is planned to include every study necessary for mastering
a particular branch of music, and all of which
taken together cover the whole art. The Institute is
enabled to execute this plan inflexibly because it is
independent of tuition fees, since the revenue from
these is supplemented by the interest of the funds. Accordingly
the fees have been fixed at moderate and
uniform rates, while no expense is spared in securing
the best talent available as a teaching and training
force.</p>

<p>The roll of the faculty contains seventy-seven names.
The faculty council which directs the policy of the Institute
consists of the director and five other experts.
Since operatic and concert managers agree that individual
instruction and criticism cannot be too carefully
given in the case of students intending to make
the performance of music a profession, and, as this
thorough system of education is equally beneficial to
the amateur, it has been adopted by the Institute. Theoretical
subjects are the only ones taught in class.</p>

<p>In addition to the direct personal teaching which the
student receives, he is surrounded by artistic and educational
influences calculated to broaden his general
knowledge and culture and to improve his taste and
discrimination. The discipline which is an essential
principle of the Institute, and which is lacking in private
instruction, where the pupil often demands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
obtains relaxing modifications of the instructor's system
to suit his inclinations, since he is paying for his
education, is of the highest value in developing character.
Students of an art which in its nature tends to
overstimulate the emotional nature need a corrective
cultivation of the powers of the intellect and the will
which students of other subjects do not so much require,
since, from their studies, intellectual development
is acquired directly and, reason being the governor
of the will, control of this great moral force is
indirectly imparted.</p>

<p>Like the National Conservatory the Institute is open
to students of both sexes, irrespective of creed or race.
The only demand is that they give proof of general
intelligence, musical ability and serious purpose. Every
regular student is required to follow a prescribed course
not only in the specific branch which he has selected,
but, in order to provide a proper foundation for this,
in the subject of music in general. The student begins
the course at the stage for which his attainments and
abilities have prepared him, as these are indicated by
three tests: as to his general knowledge of music; as
to his sense of musical hearing; as to his vocal or instrumental
talent.</p>

<p>The departments of study are singing, piano, organ,
stringed instruments, orchestra, public school music
and theoretic course. The courses are divided into
seven grades, the last four being post-graduate. The
post-graduate diplomas are of two types, called teachers'
and artists'. For the teachers' diploma two grades
of pedagogy and advanced work in theory and technique
are required; for the artists', either two or three
grades in theory, technique, and ear training, according
to the proficiency of the student, which is tested
not only by work done in the Institute, but by a public
recital before musicians not connected with the Institute.
The work of the seventh grade in the artists'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
course is confined to the study of composition in the
various forms of complete sonata, chamber music, vocal
forms, overture and orchestration. A prize sufficient
to provide for a year of European life and experience
is given annually to that graduate in any of the
artists' courses, or in composition, whom the faculty
and trustees think most deserving of the award and distinction.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The leading schools of music in Canada are the Toronto
Conservatory of Music and the Conservatorium of
Music in McGill University at Montreal.</p>

<p>The Toronto Conservatory was founded by the late
Dr. Fisher in 1886 and opened in 1887. In the thoroughness
of its courses and the completeness of its
equipment it ranks with the best conservatories in
Europe. In 1897 it purchased its present centrally located
site, in close proximity to the cluster of educational
and public buildings, and began the erection
of the structures which now form its commodious
home. Its music hall is architecturally one of the finest
edifices of the kind and its auditorium is acoustically
one of the most satisfactory halls in Canada for chamber
music and other recitals. It contains a three-manual
concert organ which is a masterpiece of Canadian
workmanship. The main hall is supplemented by
smaller ones for lectures and recitals and by practice
rooms equipped with two-manual organs. The musical
equipment in general is ample and comprehensive,
meeting the needs of the 2,500 pupils in attendance.</p>

<p>On the death of Dr. Fisher in 1913, Dr. A. S. Vogt,
whose work as conductor of the Mendelssohn Choir of
Toronto is well known, and who had been for many
years teacher of piano in the Conservatory, was advanced
to the position of director. The faculty consists
of 139 professors and instructors. It is almost exclusively
British in composition, in striking contrast to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
faculties of leading conservatories in the United States,
on whose roll Continental European names abound,
often to the point of a majority. However, many of the
instructors have received their education at foreign
conservatories.</p>

<p>The Conservatory is divided into eleven departments,
schools for the piano, the voice, the organ, the violin,
and other stringed instruments, theoretical instruction,
embracing harmony, counterpoint, composition, orchestration,
musical history and acoustics, orchestral
and band music, expression (including education,
physical culture, etc.), modern languages, piano tuning,
and kindergarten music method. The extremely practical
elements of this curriculum indicate the attention
paid to the fundamental needs of the public.</p>

<p>The Conservatory maintains an orchestra for practice
in routine and training for students sufficiently advanced
to justify their assignment to places in the organization.
Frank E. Blatchford, of the violin faculty,
who is also concert master of the Toronto Symphony
Orchestra, is the conductor.</p>

<p>The Conservatory is affiliated with its near neighbor,
the University of Toronto. Students who pass the conservatory
examinations in musical theory are exempted
from corresponding examinations by the University for
the degree of Bachelor of Music. In its desire to spread
at least a measure of musical knowledge and appreciation
among the people, the conservatory conducts correspondence
courses in musical theory, and, for the
convenience of practice, especially in the piano, maintains
eleven branches in the outlying residential districts
of Toronto.</p>

<p>The McGill University Conservatorium was opened
in 1904. The Conservatorium, however, was then only
in its experimental stage and it was not until October,
1908, that the connecting link between the University
and the Conservatorium was completed by the appointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
as director of Dr. Harry Crane Perrin, professor
of music in the University. In 1909 the orchestra was
formed, which was composed of students of the Conservatorium,
and in February of that year they gave
their first orchestral concert.</p>

<p>Henry Dike Sleeper, professor of music in Smith
College, a women's college of the first rank, has made
an interesting analysis of the character of musical instruction
given in the leading universities and colleges
where the subject is taught. He says that there are
four ideals of study:</p>

<p>1. Musical composition: Great emphasis is laid on
this at the University of Pennsylvania, and it is a predominant,
though lesser element in the schemes of
Harvard and Yale.</p>

<p>2. Public performance: This is the chief feature
of education in the conservatories affiliated with, but
not a part of the regular academic course. These conservatories
are founded largely in the West and South,
and are connected with colleges that either are for
women or are co-educational.</p>

<p>3. Culture: Amherst, Beloit, Cornell, and Tufts are
examples of institutions where the music courses tend
chiefly to imparting musical appreciation.</p>

<p>4. A balance of the three: composition, concerts,
culture. Examples of where this ideal of rounded development
is sought for are the women's colleges,
Smith and Mount Holyoke, and co-educational institutions,
such as Oberlin and Ohio Wesleyan, and the
State Universities of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Nebraska.</p>

<p>In the light they throw on the status of musical education
in American universities the following authoritative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
statistics, the latest of the kind compiled, are
illuminating:</p>

<p>In a monograph on 'Music Instruction in the United
States,' prepared by Arthur L. Manchester after exhaustive
inquiry and published by the United States Bureau
of Education in 1908, the enrollment of students of music
in 151 colleges and universities was 18,971, of whom
5,257 were men and 13,714 were women. There was
an average attendance in each institution of about 125.</p>

<p>Dr. Rudolf Tombo, registrar of Columbia University,
in an article in 'Science' for December 25, 1908, and
January 1, 1909, stated that from statistics supplied
him by twenty-five leading universities, not counting
summer schools conducted under their auspices, ten
had departments of music and five had courses of music.
In a total attendance in all departments of all the
twenty-five universities amounting to 35,885, the students
of music numbered 1,940, which is only 5.4 per
cent. of the total.</p>

<p>When the great popular interest in music, as exhibited
by the attendance at operas, concerts, and musical
festivals, is taken into consideration, this low
percentage would indicate that the universities are not
adopting attractive methods of musical instruction.
Evidently the cause of higher musical education will
be more readily served by improving the character of
instruction in the conservatories, where enthusiasm
among the students prevails, than by attempting to
wake up university men from their indifference to
music—for enthusiasm is a prerequisite in all studies
and pursuits.</p>

<p>The pioneer in creating a department of music in
American universities was John K. Paine, teacher of
music in Harvard in one capacity or another from 1862
until 1905, when he retired on a pension. Although
practical music courses, piano-playing and singing,
were taught in women's colleges, notably Vassar, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
Mr. Paine began his work in Harvard, he was the
first teacher to direct his energies toward establishing
music as an academic study, on an equality with all
the other branches, counting like them for the arts degrees
of A. B. and A. M.</p>

<p>The history of music is obviously an academic study,
and Mr. Paine judiciously began his campaign by securing
permission in 1870 to deliver a university course
of lectures on the subject. In 1870 he had persuaded
the faculty to introduce harmony and counterpoint in
the curriculum, counting for the bachelor of arts degree.
After this vital concession, the faculty could not
well deny to music full standing in the university. In
1875 Mr. Paine was appointed professor of music.</p>

<p>The indifference of the students to the art, and their
prejudice against music as an academic study, were
harder to contend with. For twenty years Prof. Paine
carried on his work without assistance in instruction
and with small classes. Then the students seemed suddenly
to wake up to the fact that a department of
music conducted on the high plane of Oxford and the
great German universities was a matter to be proud
of, and they began in increasing numbers to embrace
the rare advantage extended to them. When Prof.
Paine retired he had three assistants in his work and
over two hundred students in his classes.</p>

<p>Prof. Walter R. Spalding, Mr. Paine's successor,
aided by able teachers, such as Edward Burlingame
Hill, instructor in musical history, have continued the
good work of the founder. The course is essentially
theoretical; it includes harmony, counterpoint, musical
form, musical history, and the higher branches of composition,
including orchestration. In 1912 the students
of the department established the 'Harvard Musical Review,'
a publication of high ideals.</p>

<p>Professor Paine, and Professors Parker and MacDowell,
his contemporaries at Yale and Columbia, respectively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
achieved fame as practical exponents of the
art in its highest realm. Professors of music in European
universities as a rule are learned theorists and
historians, but not composers. It is a moot question
which class of instructors is the better. In behalf of
instruction by a creative genius it is claimed that it inspires
students with pride in their teacher and, if training
is afforded in composition, with desire to emulate
his achievements. In behalf of the academic drill-master
it is urged that the thorough grounding which
he imparts develops that all-round ability in music
which, when the purpose is in time realized by students,
will itself generate enthusiasm. The respective
merits of the two systems may thus be summed up:
the American early develops musical appreciation, the
European musical knowledge. Since these qualities
have reciprocal influence, it would seem that the two
systems should be combined, at least in America, where
musical appreciation on the part of the student can
not always be assumed, as in Europe.</p>

<p>Of the departments of music in women's colleges,
that in Wellesley may be considered the most academic.
A school of music was established in 1875, its pupils
being drawn chiefly from the special students, who
lacked preparation for the regular college studies and
so were limited to the so-called 'accomplishments' of
music and drawing, with a smattering of literature. As
it became increasingly evident that the emphasis in the
school of music was on performance—the development
of highly specialized skill—and that the predominating
interests in the college were intellectual rather than
vocational, the school was seen to be out of place.
The students diminished in members to less than 100
in 1895. In 1896-7 the school was converted into a
regular department of the college, the curriculum in
music being made mainly theoretical, the courses being
harmony, counterpoint, musical form, history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
music, and free composition. The director since 1897
has been Hamilton C. Macdougall. There are eight
other professors in the department faculty, and students
number over two hundred. In 1907 Billings Hall
was erected for the use of the department. While
practice in music has been subordinated to theory, it
has been retained and even improved since the school
became the department. Indeed, in 1897 a college orchestra
was organized.</p>

<p>The four leading women's colleges in the East, Vassar,
Wellesley, Smith, and Mt. Holyoke, have much the
same curriculum in music, instruction being given in
both theory and practice with mutual benefit resulting
from the reacting influence one on the other. In this
respect it would seem that these institutions have a decided
advantage over such universities as Harvard,
where there is no training in musical performance.</p>

<p>In the same year that music was made a part of
the curriculum of Harvard (1875), classes in music
were inaugurated at the University of Pennsylvania
under Professor Hugh A. Clarke. As has already been
stated, the attention paid to composition is the distinguishing
feature of the course.</p>

<p>In 1894 the department of music was established in
Yale University, and Horatio W. Parker, Mus. D., was
placed at its head. At present there are nine other
professors and instructors in the faculty of the department.
The aims of Dr. Parker and his assistants are
to provide adequate instruction for those who desire
to become musicians by profession, either as teachers
or as composers, and to afford a course of study for
those who intend to devote themselves to musical criticism
and the literature of music. Accordingly the
work of the department is divided into practical and
theoretical courses. The practical courses consist of
instruction in pianoforte, organ, violin, and violoncello
playing, in singing, and in chamber music (ensemble-playing).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
No student is admitted to a practical
course other than singing and violoncello playing
unless he is also taking at least one of the theoretical
courses.</p>

<p>The theoretical courses are subdivided into elementary
and advanced. The former class includes harmony,
counterpoint, and the history of music; the latter
class instrumentation, advanced orchestration and
conducting, and strict and free composition. Both
courses in composition are under the immediate direction
of Dr. Parker, whose special fitness has been
commented upon in another chapter. Dr. Parker requires
every student in the composition courses to produce
an extended original work. This usually takes the
form of a sonata. The students are incited to excel in
original composition as well as in artistic performance
by the Sandford Fellowship, which gives two years'
study abroad to the most gifted performer who shall
also show marked ability as a composer.</p>

<p>Allied with the department is the New Haven Symphony
Orchestra, a complete and well-equipped organization
of seventy players, which gives a series of
concerts during the winter. It affords opportunity to
the students of orchestration to hear their work actually
and adequately played, and, when its quality warrants,
to have the composition publicly performed. Several
original works are thus produced every year. They are
commonly overtures, but piano concertos and other
works have occasionally been presented.</p>

<p>The orchestra also opens to the student a gateway
into professional life by admitting to it those whose
performance on the violin or violoncello has been approved.
Students of the piano, as well as of the violin,
are allowed to rehearse with the orchestra and
even to perform publicly if their fitness to do so has
been demonstrated. The students give informal recitals
from time to time and, toward the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
college year, a concert, accompanied by the Symphony
Orchestra.</p>

<p>This insistence on the study of the theory of music
and the demonstration of the theoretical principles
by original composition as the only proper foundation
of education in the art are the distinguishing characteristics
of the Yale department of music, and the practical
achievements of Dr. Parker and his students would
seem to justify the soundness of the idea.</p>

<p>In 1896 Edward MacDowell, the composer, was
called to the chair of music in Columbia University.
Mr. MacDowell, either because of his temperament or
the limitations imposed by the university on his work,
did not find the position so congenial as Dr. Parker
has done at Yale. Instead of being inspired by teaching
to greater feats of composition, Mr. MacDowell seemed
hampered, and, to the great loss of American music,
produced fewer and fewer of those fine works which
cause him to be acclaimed as the greatest of American
composers. He resigned the position in 1904, two years
before his death.</p>

<p>In 1906 the department of music which had developed
independently in the Teachers' College was combined
with the department in the university to form
the Columbia School of Music. Cornelius Rübner, Mus.
D., is the present head. The declared aims of Prof. Rübner
and his four associates in the faculty of the school
are to treat music historically and æsthetically, as an
element of liberal culture; to teach it scientifically and
technically, with a view to training musicians who
shall be competent to teach and compose; and to provide
practical training in orchestral music. There are
a university chorus and an orchestra (the Columbia
Philharmonic) in connection with the school, which
present much the same opportunities to the students
as those afforded by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra
to the Yale students. The school holds two annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
concerts of original compositions by its students and
conducts many other concerts as well as public lectures
and recitals.</p>

<p>The various courses may be counted toward the degrees
of bachelor of music, of arts, of science, and
master of arts. The curriculum includes the history
of music, conducted by Prof. Daniel Gregory Mason;
harmony, counterpoint, sight-singing and playing;
composition, orchestration, and symphonic form, conducted
by Prof. Rübner. The school also offers courses
in teaching and supervising music at the Teachers
College. The equipment of the school is large and
comprehensive. The department of music in the University
Library contains a well-selected working collection
not only of treatises but also of compositions.
The private library of Anton Seidl, consisting of 1,220
scores, which was presented to the university, has been
placed in the rooms of the School of Music.</p>

<p>The University School of Music at Ann Arbor, which
is conducted by the Musical Society of the University
of Michigan, was founded by Prof. Henry S. Frieze,
and its membership is restricted to officers, graduates,
and students of the university. In 1888 the present
head of the school, Albert A. Stanley, took charge.
He greatly strengthened the technical and theoretical
work. Under his direction the policy of the school
has been to train a few students thoroughly rather than
many superficially. The courses are those generally
given in schools of music connected with American
universities: harmony, single and double counterpoint;
canon and fugue; history of music; analysis and criticism;
musical appreciation.</p>

<p>Since our Western State universities form each the
summit of public education in its state, such institutions
as Michigan pay much attention to training teachers
of music in the public schools. The University of
Wisconsin goes much further than this. In connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
with its admirable University School of Music,
which is one of the best in the country in that not only
the theory of music is taught in the most approved
academic fashion, but practice is also afforded in
choral and instrumental music, and it has established a
'university extension' division for educating the whole
people of the state in music.</p>

<p>As stated in a bulletin of the university, the School
of Music stands ready to assist any community in
strengthening its musical life by the following means:</p>

<div class="block1 p11 small1">

<p class="hang">1.<span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">It</span>  gives advice to communities desiring such aid, by
sending to it an expert who studies the situation, and, with
local representatives, prepares a plan of action.</p>

<p class="hang">2. <span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">It</span> supplies lists of materials, names of persons and books
that would be helpful to the plan.</p>

<p class="hang">3. <span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">It</span> rents out at low cost such materials, including chorus
music and material for bands and orchestras.</p>

<p class="hang">4. <span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">It</span> supplies at reasonable prices musical attractions of
high quality and wide variety, such as concerts and lecture
recitals—singly or in series.</p>

<p class="hang">5. <span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">It</span> assists in providing competent music teachers to communities
which are too small to support them unaided. These
teachers direct the music in the public schools and assist in
general community music, both vocal and instrumental, and in
the music of churches and social organizations.</p>

<p class="hang">6. <span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">Through</span> the coöperation of the Wisconsin University
School of Music, the American Federation of Music, and other
organizations, it assists in building up bands and orchestras
throughout the State by supplying organizers and teachers.</p>

<p class="hang">7. <span style="padding-left: 0.7em;">It</span> conducts correspondence courses in which experts
give advice in solving the various problems which arise in
connection with school and church music, bands, orchestras,
choruses, and concerts.</p>
</div>

<p>Truly an extensive program and one worthy of
emulation.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The introduction of music into the public schools
has already been discussed. It is a great tribute to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
the soundness of the pedagogic principles laid down by
Mason and Woodbridge, the pioneers in juvenile musical
education, that, despite the many new methods
which have been tried, music in the public school is
largely conducted along the original lines. Singing
in chorus with use of specially prepared and successively
graded exercises printed on charts or written on
the blackboard and song books, and, most important of
all, under the leadership of a teacher with winning personality
and knowledge of the childish mind, has been
found to produce the best results. So great proficiency
has been achieved in the training of juvenile choruses
for musical festivals that the only really satisfactory
choruses given by a great multitude of persons are the
choruses of children, some of which have exceeded
three thousand voices.</p>

<p>The basis of juvenile instruction in music is marked
rhythm and simple melody, with a short range of
pitch, which are best taught in unison. The voices of
the children with a good natural ear being fortunately
in a large majority they tend to correct the defective
auditory perception of the minority.</p>

<p>When the voices of the children are sufficiently
trained by singing together simple rote songs, musical
analysis is begun. The notes are taught to be recognized
first by the ear, and then by the eye, and a practical
application of this knowledge is made by exercises
and songs. The same general process is pursued
until, by the time the pupil reaches the higher grades,
he has acquired an ability to sing at sight any new
song which a non-professional musician is likely to
be called on to render.</p>

<p>In small American towns the regular teachers in the
public schools carry on musical exercises. But they
are not without easy access to knowledge of approved
methods, for this is published in a special magazine,
'The School Music Monthly,' which was established in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
1900. Many other magazines, educational as well as
musical, contain articles and even departments on the
subject.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there exists a great and influential
organization, the Music Teachers' National Association,
which was founded in 1876 with Dr. Eben Tourjée
as its president. This uses every means in the
power of an extra-governmental association to keep
up the standard of musical education in the country.
It holds annual sessions wherein methods in musical
pedagogy are presented and discussed. In many states
similar associations are found whose membership is
confined to music teachers in the state. These are not
affiliated with the National Association, and their activities
are less general in scope, although of more immediate
interest to the members because applied to
matters of special concern.</p>

<p>Cities of from 8,000 to 200,000 inhabitants usually
employ a special teacher to direct instruction in music
in the public schools. Larger cities have a number
of these teachers and one or more supervisors or directors
of public school music. New York, for example,
has one director, one assistant director and
fifty-six special teachers. From the vastness and complexity
of the situation in the largest cities, musical
education has of necessity become highly systematized
and correspondingly efficient.</p>

<p>New York perfected its system about 1900. The capstone
may be said to be the public musical lectures
and performances given in connection with the evening
lecture courses presented in the public schools and
other public buildings under the general auspices of
the Board of Education and the special supervision of
Dr. Henry M. Leipziger.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is only since the beginning of the century
that the country in general has come to recognize
at all adequately the supreme importance of musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
culture to community or civic life. As a result of this
recognition there has been a general movement in the
central and western states, and in encouragement of
the study of music to add the forces of private instruction
to public by giving credit in the schools for musical
work done outside of them, which credit many
state universities have in turn accepted by admitting
high school graduates upon their certificates.</p>

<p>A more spectacular expression of appreciation of the
value of music to community life is the growing use
of children's singing for musical festivals, concerts,
and pageants. In many cities the performance by public
school children of concerts ranging from simple
unison songs to part songs, cantatas, and even light
operas has become a regular feature of community
life. In many cases school orchestras and bands have
accompanied the choruses. In this way the public
schools have become foreshadowings of the conservatories
and the university schools of music. In time
the weak spot in our higher musical curricula, the
course in 'musical appreciation' which so many idlers
follow as a 'royal road' to a musical education (although
it is found in none of the Royal Conservatories
of Europe), will have no excuse for being retained, for
our high school pupils will already possess it in sufficient
measure to pursue with zest the hard technical
courses the mastery of which is necessary to the making
of a real musician.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>While the American people have shown themselves
opposed to the conduct or subsidization of music by
the national government, as this has been often proposed
in plans for a national conservatory, we have
seen, in the case of Wisconsin, that this does not apply
to the state governments, at least in respect to the feature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
of popular education in music. Still less does it
apply to the conduct of music by the municipal government.
For many years the 'city fathers' of most
American municipalities have provided band concerts
in the public parks during the summer season. The
programs of these concerts, however, until quite recently,
were planned with little regard to education
of the people in appreciation of the best music—the
selections being of the so-called 'popular' order, the
prevalent opinion of the directors being that the mass
of the American people did not enjoy music of a high
order.</p>

<p>A few far-seeing men, whose prescience was based
on long and intimate acquaintance with the musical
taste of every class in the community, had a confident
faith that if selections of the best music were placed
on the programs of the park concerts the public would
become rapidly educated to prefer them to the other
selections. This was done, and the result showed that
the proposers of the innovation had been, if anything,
too reserved in their prophecy. From the very beginning
the new selections met with favor. Music lovers,
many attending for the first time, crowded into the
parks to hear the concerts and, by their intense interest
during the performance and enthusiastic hand-clapping
at its close, they not only silenced opposition,
but even converted it into approval.</p>

<p>Said Arthur Farwell, supervisor of municipal music
in New York from 1910 to 1913, in 'The Craftsmen'
(Nov., 1910): 'The little comedy of resistance to classical
music on the part of the average American man
ends when he finds himself one of fifteen thousand
similar persons—as happened repeatedly in New York
this summer—listening in perfect silence to the great
musical imaginings of the age by that most wonderful
of instruments, the modern orchestra in the hands
of a capable leader.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>New York is the acknowledged leader of American
cities, and in many respects is their model in this development
of municipal music from the most defective
of instrumentalities for educating the people in musical
appreciation into possibly its most effective one.
Accordingly the story of the regeneration wrought in
this municipality will indicate better than any other
account the movement in the same direction all over
the country. And for purposes of record it is well
to quote Mr. Farwell, who in his official position was
mainly responsible for the revolution:</p>

<p>'Municipal music in New York falls within the province
of two departments, the Department of Parks and
the Department of Docks and Ferries. It has been customary
in the past to have frequent band and orchestral
concerts at the Mall in Central Park with organizations
of some size, and to have weekly concerts by
smaller bands of twenty-one men and a leader in a
number of the other parks. It has also been customary
to have concerts nightly on all of the nine recreation
piers on the North and East Rivers.</p>

<p>'Without describing the status of most of the music in
the past, it may at least be said that the administrations
supporting it let the work out to many independent
band leaders, without requiring the upholding of musical
standards, or having the means to uphold them,
and without even suggesting such standards.</p>

<p>'The task of the new department heads, Charles B.
Stover, Commissioner of the Department of Parks, and
Calvin Tomkins, Commissioner of the Department of
Docks and Ferries,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> was therefore to place the work
of providing municipal music upon a basis admitting
of musical standards, and thus to make possible the
systematic carrying out of new and progressive ideas.</p>

<p>'In the Park Department, Commissioner Stover's first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>act in extending the scope and influence of the municipal
music was to increase the number of music centres.
Most important of all, he increased the number of symphony
orchestras to two, and opened a new music centre
for orchestral music at McGowan's Pass in the upper
end of the park, where there is a natural amphitheatre.
The crowds from the upper East Side that frequent
this portion of the park are made up of persons
who for the most part have never heard a symphony
orchestra. It is an interesting fact that at the first concert
given them there was much curiosity, but little real
response, up to the performance of a movement from
a Beethoven symphony, which brought forth prolonged
and enthusiastic applause until an encore number was
played. The concerts at McGowan's Pass have grown
steadily and rapidly in popularity, eager audiences of
from four to six thousand, or more, assembling at every
performance....</p>

<p>'One other feature of fundamental importance in any
truly national development, a feature wholly new, has
marked the season's concerts in Central Park. This
is the establishment by Commissioner Stover of a rule
that each of the two orchestras shall perform one new
or little-heard composition by an American composer
each week. This is a step of the utmost moment, not
so much in the mere gaining of a hearing for the works
now performed, as in the recognition of the composers
of our own land as a factor in the creation of America's
dawning musical democracy.</p>

<p>'On the recreation piers the band concerts provided
by the Dock Department have been enjoyed by many
thousands. An innovation there has been to classify
the program, and give the concerts distinctive character
on different evenings—an Italian Opera Night, American
Night, Wagner Night, Folk Songs and Dances, German-Slavonic
Night, etc....</p>

<p>'In these activities of only a single summer, it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
be seen what a vista of possibilities has been revealed.
If these developments have any meaning whatsoever,
they have a meaning of the deepest sort for every
American city and village. The magnitude of New
York's operations is not the most important point. We
are most deeply concerned with the spirit of these progressive
activities, a spirit which may find its appropriate
expression wherever there exists a community,
large or small, which senses the upward trend of American
humanity and democracy.'</p>

<p>We have been frequently obliged to indicate, in the
course of our 'Narrative History of Music,' that certain
known facts about musical beginnings were not first
facts—that there were premises upon which these facts
were based—beyond the ken of the historian. Thus
we discovered that some time in the early centuries of
our era a type of chant known as plain-song was systematized
by musicians, but we were unable to reveal
the actual source of that music; later we came upon a
more or less artistic expression in the form of troubadour
songs, and again found their actual source
shrouded in mystery—or tradition—and so forth. We
were consequently forced to the conclusion that, as
practice precedes theory, something else precedes artistic
music, which is its source and real beginning. That
something is the elementary expression of the race—or
folk-song. Art music is rooted in folk-song as surely
as the tree is rooted in the soil.</p>

<p>Folk-song is the musical expression of the racial
genius. Art music is the <em>individual</em> expression of the
same genius, plus the personal character of the artist.
However distinctive or individual his expression, no
composer has been able to divorce himself from the
racial genius of which he is a part, any more than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
poet of a nation has been able to rise above the national
idiom. 'A creative artist,' says Mr. Henry F. Gilbert,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
'is like a noble tree. However tall the tree may grow,
pointing ever heavenward, it still has its roots in the
soil below and draws its sustenance therefrom. So
with the great creative artist: however elevated and
universal his utterances become, the roots of his being
are so deeply embedded in the consciousness of the race
of which he is a part, that the influence and color of
this race spirit will be apparent in his greatest works.'</p>

<p>It follows, then, that a composition, if it is to be great,
will be recognizable not only as the work of a man, but
also as the product of a race. This may sound radical
in the abstract, but the fact is easily demonstrated by
concrete examples. To quote from the same source:
'When we survey with our mind's eye the bulk of German
music and contrast it with the bulk of French
music or Italian music we immediately perceive that
there is a fundamental difference between them. Never
mind whether we can define it or not, there the difference
is, and I believe that most of us recognize it without
any trouble. At bottom this difference is because
of the difference in race. Inasmuch as the Italian composer
in his music unconsciously expresses the peculiar
temper and character of the people among whom he
has been born and of whom he is a spiritual as well as a
physical fragment, so the German composer expresses,
likewise unconsciously, the quite different temper and
character of the people from whom he sprang....
How can any one fail to recognize these national, or,
say, racial characteristics? But there is a school of
critics which maintains that the greatest music strikes
the universal note, and is free from the taint of nationalism.
If this were so we might expect to find the
greatest music of Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Finland,
or any other country to be very similar in its appeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
and effect. We should find all this great music to
be lacking in special racial character and to be expressive
only of those characteristics which are common to
all the different peoples. If this were true it would,
of course, be possible to conceive of any <em>great</em> piece of
music having been written by any person regardless of
his nationality. But can you do it? Can you, for instance,
conceive of Beethoven's symphonies being the
normal expression of an Italian? Or of 'Tristan' having
been written by an Englishman? Can you imagine the
'Pathétique' Symphony of Tschaikowsky having been
written by a Frenchman, or Verdi's 'Otello' composed
by a Norwegian? No; the trail of nationality is over
them all.... I believe that the greatest creative artists
have ever been national in the deepest sense of the
word. They have been the mouthpieces of a people,
and, while in their works they unrolled new and hitherto
unknown visions of beauty, their masterpieces have
always been an expression and extension of the race
consciousness rather than a contradiction and denial
of it.'</p>

<p>If we accept this dictum, it will be quite rational, in
treating the music of any nation, to begin at the bottom—by
defining the sources and general character of its
folk-song. We should have no difficulty in doing this
in the case of France, Germany, or, say, Spain, which
are more or less racially simple, but not so when we
take a country like Austria, for instance, which is the
home of at least three different racial stocks. Each of
these has a well-developed music of its own, which has
a well-defined racial complexion quite distinct from
that of the others. Now America is precisely in this
position, but in a very much higher degree. We have
not three, but thirty or more different racial stocks, and
of these perhaps six or seven are of sufficient strength
and sufficient permanence to have become definitely
associated with the American soil. Only in a limited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
sense, however, are these race settlements 'localized,'
as they are in Austria, and therefore capable of retaining
in any degree their characteristics and traditions.
America's position is, in fact, unique in that it fuses all
these apparently antagonistic elements, thus obliterating
in a large measure their own racial peculiarities
and, by the addition of a new, a neutralizing element,
substituting a new product. That product is still in
the making, and the neutralizing element is so intangible
as to defy definite description. Indefinitely it is the
spirit born of the sense of liberty of action, opportunity
and optimistic endeavor which colors the character of
every settler or immigrant, irrespective of his extraction.</p>

<p>In contemplating the chaotic state of our 'national'
music and in realizing that its ultimate character is in
its formative stage, we are too apt to forget that it too
has its folk-song antecedents, however heterogeneous
they may be. We are not here concerned with the ultimate
product, but with its ingredients. If these are
partly English, Irish, Scotch, German, French, and
Spanish, they are nevertheless legitimate, though these
foreign ingredients may be dismissed with a mere mention
in so far as they have suffered no peculiar transformation
upon American soil; those that <em>have</em> suffered
transformation, like those that are indigenous,
must receive attention because they have become legitimate
material for our composers to draw upon in order
to identify their art with their country. In spite of the
peculiar position of America with regard to artistic individuality,
then, we may be justified in treating the
story of American creative musical art in the usual
manner—beginning with folk-song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Since we have drawn the distinction between adapted
and indigenous folk-song, the question naturally arises
whether there exists in America a truly indigenous
folk-song at all. It has been agreed that America, having
been colonized by Europeans, possesses no native
culture whatever, except such as the Indians may have
had. The Indian, indeed, has the best claim to the
name American, being indigenous, or at least so early
a colonizer as to have constituted virtually a native
race. But being the one element which has not been
fused with the many elements of which the American
nation is now composed, he is to-day in the anomalous
position of an indigenous foreigner. For the American
of to-day is predominantly European—of overseas origin—and
the European conquerors have, in this case,
not adopted the 'culture' of the vanquished, because
that culture was inferior to their own.</p>

<p>The North American Indian has shown unquestioned
evidences of art instincts—in his folk-lore, his handicrafts,
and perhaps also in his music. But, with respect
to the last, his impulses are so circumscribed by
religious formulas and so little affected by a sense of
proportion that they hardly achieve even the mildest
form of artistic expression or design. Moreover, the
idiom he employs is so foreign to us, so exotic in its
nature, that either an unconscious or an impulsive
use of it by American composers would be out of the
question. What use has been made of Indian material
has been with the conscious purpose of lending a savage
character or local color to the music, as in the
preëminent case of MacDowell's 'Indian Suite.' This is
exactly analogous to the use of Oriental color by such
composers as Saint-Saëns or Delibes. 'Arrangements,'
or harmonizations, attempted upon the basis of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
European scale have led to some pleasing results at
the hands of Frederick R. Burton, Arthur Farwell and
others, but at a total sacrifice of the original character
of the tunes. What appeal such arrangements have to
our ears depends entirely upon the harmonic texture
or a readjustment of the melody according to European
ideas, not upon its intrinsic value.</p>

<p>'Folk-songs are echoes of the heart-beats of the vast
folk and in them are preserved feelings, beliefs and
habits of vast antiquity. Not only in the words, which
have almost monopolized folk-song study so far, but
also in music and perhaps more truthfully in the music
than in the words. Music cannot lie, for the reason
that the things which are at its base, the things without
which it could not be, are unconscious, involitional
human products.'<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It is evident that unless we understand
or feel 'the things which are at its base' we cannot
respond to the utterances that express them. If for
no other reason, the songs of the Indian, because they
express the emotions of man at a lower and totally
foreign stage of culture, cannot enter into assimilation,
with our own. They are therefore not significant to
Americans as folk-songs and we have accordingly
treated them under the heading of Primitive Music in
Volume I (pp. 1 ff.).</p>

<p>With the Indian rejected as a source of folk-song
where are we to find such sources? Folk-songs, according
to a dictionary definition, are 'marked by certain
peculiarities of rhythm, form, and melody, which are
traceable, more or less clearly, to racial (or national)
temperament, modes of life, climatic and political conditions,
geographical environment and language.' The
distinction of one kind of folk-song from another therefore
depends upon a difference in these peculiarities,
and we shall have to look for distinctive characteristics
that belong to no other race if we are to find a truly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>indigenous folk-song. On the other hand, the <em>conditions</em>
under which folk-song grows (for it does 'grow'
while its sophisticated counterpart is 'built') are essentially
the same. The proverbial dictum that 'sorrow is
the mother of song' is true as a general rule. It is
borne out by the fact that a great majority of the folk-songs
of all nations carry a note of melancholy, and a
great preponderance of all such songs is in the minor
mode. But this is particularly so in Northern countries.
No doubt the harsher climatic conditions impose
a heavier burden of care. Mr. Krehbiel, who has
examined many folk-songs with regard to the relative
proportion of modes, remarks that nearly all of Russian
song shows the minor predominance peculiar to
Northern countries, and he concludes that political conditions
have much the same effect as climatic ones.</p>

<p>Of course, the songs of happiness are many, too, but
even these are in a measure the product of suffering,
for man recognizes well-being very often only by contrast;
continuous bliss he is apt to manifest by indifference.
Hence we are not surprised that the strongest
outbursts of joy, often wild and boisterous, are common
to the nations whose dominant note is grief.
But whatever the country, folk-song springs invariably
from the poorest classes, and most often from the
peasant, for, exposed to the phenomena of nature as
well as to economic stress, his imagination is constantly
stirred by the beauties of the earth, the mysteries and
the tragedy of life.</p>

<p>In looking for analogous conditions in America we
may think first of the pioneer, the early settler, who
no doubt had hardships to endure and privations to
suffer. But by peculiar circumstances he was unfitted
for the creation of song. Springing largely from a notoriously
unimaginative tradesman's class, inspired by
the stern principles of a piety that deliberately suppressed
impulsive expression as sinful, and almost constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
engaged in savage warfare, he may hardly be
looked upon as an originator of poetic beauty. Moreover,
his English culture clung to him for generations,
while politically he considered himself an Englishman.
The songs he sang, therefore, were the songs of his
fathers, and precious little social opportunity he had
for indulging in their charm. Isolation and lack of
communication effectually precluded a current interchange
of ideas.</p>

<p>In a great measure these conditions apply to the subsequent
generations of all European races in America—the
pioneers as well as the later immigrants. Their
own traditions, whatever their nationality, are preserved
for a generation or so to the exclusion of new influences;
then the old songs die away and the memory
of them becomes obliterated in the great stream of cosmopolitanism.
Only in isolated spots, where a race,
especially strong in tradition or racial peculiarities, or
where a mere aggregation of people, united in a common
mode of life, is sequestered, have these traditions
survived or engendered new ones. Instances of this
are the French Canadians, the Creoles of Louisiana, the
Spanish-Americans of Mexico and California, and the
mountaineers of Kentucky and Virginia. These people
have a folk-song peculiar to themselves, which is
founded, however, upon a traditional racial idiom, and
may therefore be classed as 'adapted' or 'transformed'
folk-song. For the indigenous American folk-song we
shall have to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>The only caste in American history whose condition
in any way resembled that of the peasant class in Europe
was the negro slave of the South. Not only was
he subjected to sufferings, hardships, and oppression,
but, injected into a civilization in which he found himself
an outcast, he was forced to create a racial existence
for himself, which, while it adapted elements of
the society that ruled him, nevertheless was bound to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
be distinctive because of a peculiar admixture of savage
customs and superstitions, the imperfection of his
understanding, and the extraordinary emotional makeup
of his character. The negro in his uncivilized way
was endowed with the ingenuousness of a child, and
the susceptibility to impressions that goes with the untutored
mind. He had a childlike, poetic nature, a
natural gift of song, an emotionalism and a sentimentality
that responded unfailingly to all the pangs of an
unjust and cruel existence. The ruthless severing of
family ties, the physical pains, the hardships of labor
found a direct expression in his music, the idiom of
which was partly innate and partly acquired. Add to
this the intense religious excitement to which the negro
is subject—an emotion which seems to have translated
itself with all its elemental power from savage idolatry
to Christian worship—and you have a combination
which could not but produce a striking result. 'Nowhere
save on the plantation of the South could the
emotional life which is essential to the development
of true folk-song be developed, nowhere else was there
the necessary meeting of the spiritual cause and the
simple agent and vehicle.'<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The peculiar fact that the one true indigenous class
of American folk-song is the product of an African race
is, as we have seen, due to circumstances alone. It is
no reflection upon the capabilities of the other races
for artistic expression. It simply demonstrates the fact
that folk-song grows under certain conditions and no
other. A nation that is prosperous, that is plunged
headlong into the feverish activities of industrial progress,
cannot be expected to bring forth melancholy
'complaints' or gems of contemplative lyricism. But
there come even to such nations moments of national
stress that give rise to unusual outbursts. While these
are usually voiced by single individuals, they reproduce
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>so vividly the spirit of the people that they often rank
with folk-songs in spontaneity and directness. Such
are the patriotic songs, whose creation accompanied
every war and every revolution. Often they are mere
adaptations of freshly composed words to old but stirring
tunes, which thus take on a new significance—often
these very tunes are 'captured' from the enemy
and annexed to the country's flag. Such was the case
in the War of the Revolution, in the War of 1812, and
again in the Civil War. These songs—not strictly folk-songs—might
better be described as 'songs in the folk
manner,' a distinction indicated in German by the adjective
<em>volkstümlich</em> or <em>volksmässig</em>.</p>

<p>Such songs in the folk manner follow in the wake of
every considerable folk-song tradition. They have not
failed to do so in America, and it is significant that the
spirit which they reproduce or aim to reproduce is the
spirit of the negro folk-song. The movement, or after-movement,
started with the imitation of negro ditties
by white composers in connection with the so-called
negro minstrel troupes which, beginning about 1845,
became a favorite form of amusement in the United
States. Its culmination must be recognized in the work
of such men as Stephen Foster and Henry Clay Work,
whose works are part of the permanent stock of American
lyrics. Beyond this the negro song has had an
influence upon the so-called American popular song, a
degenerate type which has appropriated, often in distorted
form, some of the character of plantation song,
notably the peculiar form of syncopation known as
'ragtime.'</p>

<p>We have now enumerated all the subdivisions of
folk-song in its broader sense: the native folk-song
proper, exemplified by the negro plantation song; the
song in the folk manner, exemplified by the negro minstrel
tunes, the work of Stephen Foster and the patriotic
songs, adapted or original; the adapted folk-song of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
French-Canadian, Spanish-American, the Kentucky
mountaineer, etc.; and, finally, the simon-pure folk-song
of foreign birth, perpetuated in America by immigrants.
All of these are vital forces in American
composition and as such must receive more detailed
attention.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The discussion of the negroes' claim to the title
'American' would be perhaps out of place at this late
date, and particularly in this place, were it not that
a considerable class of American citizens has denied to
them not only social equality but equal consideration
and opportunity as a native citizen of the country. The
preponderance of European blood in the nation hardly
justifies this any more than it would justify the exclusion
of the large number of Americans that are of
anciently oriental origin. In contrast with this the name
'American' is never denied to the Indian, but priority
of settlement can hardly be argued in his favor, for
by such reasoning the negro has superior claims over
some of the 'elect' of the white elements among Americans.
Negroes were sold into slavery in Virginia before
the landing of the Pilgrims in 1790. The first census
of the United States showed 759,208 negroes, and
to-day they constitute nearly 13 per cent. of the entire
population. Their intellectual powers have been amply
proved by the achievements of individual members of
the race, in science, in education, and in the arts. It
is hardly necessary to name such men as Booker T.
Washington, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and Dr. Burghardt
DuBois in support of this. Mr. Krehbiel, however,
does well in quoting the last-named of these in
proving the present contention:</p>

<p>'Your country? How came it yours? Before the
Pilgrims landed we were here. Here we have brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
three gifts and mingled them with yours—a gift of
story and song, soft stirring melody in an ill-harmonized
and unmelodious land; the gift of sweat and brawn
to beat back the wilderness, conquer the soil and lay the
foundations of this vast economic empire two hundred
years earlier than your weak hands could have
done it; the third a gift of the Spirit. Around us the
history of the land has centred for thrice a hundred
years; out of the nation's heart we have called all that
was best, to throttle and subdue what was worst; fire
and blood, prayer and sacrifice have billowed over this
people, and they have found peace only in the altars
of the God of Right....'</p>

<p>The negroes' songs are sung in the language of the
country—or a dialect of it; and, while they do not
voice the sentiments of the entire population—no song
in a country so heterogeneous could do that—they are
American songs by the same right that the peasant
songs of Russia are Russian or the song of any other
class of Americans would be American.</p>

<p>In order to prove the originality of the negro folk-song
it has been necessary to combat the opinion of so
learned a writer as Dr. Wallaschek,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> who has contended
that these songs are 'unmistakably "arranged"—not
to say ignorantly borrowed—from the national
songs of all nations, from military signals, well-known
marches, German students' songs, etc., unless it is pure
accident which has caused me to light upon traces of
so many of them.' This radical statement, while it
has the force of scientific deduction, is erroneous in
the premises upon which these deductions are based.
Dr. Wallaschek has relied too freely upon the testimony
of travellers whose musical knowledge is doubtful
and he has evidently confused genuine slave songs
with imitations of them, such as the so-called minstrel
tunes written by whites. Besides, as Mr. Krehbiel very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>plausibly remarks, 'similarities exist between the folk-songs
of all peoples. Their overlapping is a necessary
consequence of the proximity and intermingling of
peoples, like modifications of language; and there are
some characteristics which all songs except those of
the rudest and most primitive kind must have in common.
The prevalence of the diatonic scales and march-rhythms,
for instance, make parallels invariable. If
the use of such scales and rhythms in the folk-songs
of the American negroes is an evidence of plagiarism or
imitation, it is to be feared that the peoples whose
music they put under tribute have been equally culpable
with them. Mr. William Francis Allen—with
Charles Pickard Ware and Lucy McKim Garrison the
compiler of the most famous collection of negro songs<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>—while
admitting that negro music is partly imitative
of the music of the whites, says that 'in the main it
appears to be original in the best sense of the word,
and the more we examine the subject, the more genuine
it appears to be.' Only in a very few songs does Mr.
Allen trace strains of less familiar music which the
slaves heard their masters sing or play. In spite of
this, the songs themselves prove that they are the spontaneous
utterances of an entire people. As in the case
of all folk-songs, their first germs were uttered by individual
spokesmen, but these germs were such genuine
reflections of sentiments common to all and were
subjected to such modifications in their travels from
lip to lip as to assume the character of a composite
expression of the race. They are indeed 'original and
native products. They contain idioms transplanted
hither from Africa, but as songs they are the product
of American institutions, of the social, political, and
geographical environment within which their creators
were placed in America; of the joys, sorrows, and experiences
which fell to their lot in America.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>
<p>Having established the 'Americanism' and the originality
of the negro folk-song, and having stated the presence
of an African as well as European element, we
may now attempt to point definitely to instances of
both. Generally speaking, the African characteristics
consist of rhythmic and melodic aberration, while the
European ingredients find expression in the harmonic
structure and the style of the melodies as far as they
are influenced by that structure. But this statement
is subject to qualifications. While the African, like
every other exotic race, is generally innocent of harmonic
science, travellers have brought evidences of a
genuine natural feeling for harmony among the African
tribes. Thus a German officer recounted to John W. D.
Moodie<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> how his playing of an aria from Gluck's <em>Orfeo</em>
on the violin was immediately imitated <em>with accompaniments</em>
by the native Hottentots. Peter Kolbe,
writing in 1719, testified to the Hottentots' playing of
their <em>gom-goms</em> in harmony, and Mr. Krehbiel records
the singing of a Dahoman minstrel at the World's
Columbian Exposition (1893) to the accompaniment of
a Chinese harp as follows: 'With his right hand he
played over and over again a descending passage of
dotted crotchets and quavers in thirds; with his left
hand he syncopated ingeniously on the highest tuned
string.' According to the same writer, another investigator,
Dr. Wangemann, transcribed a hymn by a Kaffir
in which the solos were sung in unison but the refrain
in full harmony. These instances should give some clue
to the extraordinary ability of negroes to 'harmonize,'
that is, improvise harmonies to a given melody.</p>

<p>Of course, the strongest musical accomplishment of
the African is his extraordinary command of rhythm.
As is the case with most primitive music, the rhythm
of the African music is determined by the native
dances. The drum, which marks the rhythm, is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>most important instrument of the African, and his ability
upon it is nothing short of marvellous. He has developed
a 'drum language' which he uses in signalling
in war time and for communication at long distance.
'The most refined effects of the modern tympanist seem
to be put in the shade by the devices used by African
drummers in varying the sound of their instruments
so as to make them convey meanings, not by conventional
formulas but by actual imitation of words.'<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Their ability to use cross rhythms and intricate effects
of syncopation is evidently inherited by the American
negroes, whose prowess in that direction may be verified
in a thousand dance halls. Syncopation and the
peculiar form of it which Mr. Krehbiel refers to as the
'Scotch snap' is indeed the outstanding characteristic
of all negro music. The short note on a strong beat
immediately followed by a longer one on a weak beat,
and the consequent shifted rhythm popularly known as
'ragtime' is scarcely ever absent in negro folk-music.
That it is a heritage from Africa seems to be conclusively
proved by the recording of such melodies as
these:</p>

<p>Next to their rhythmic snap, the most radically outlandish
characteristic of the negro songs is their frequent
variation from the diatonic scale. This most
often takes the form of a raised (major) sixth in a
minor key (while the seventh is not varied or is omitted
altogether); the raised seventh in the minor scale, or
the flattened seventh in the major. Besides these 'wild
notes,' as Mr. Krehbiel calls them, there are omissions
of certain notes of the scale that produce a decided exotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
effect. Thus we have the major scale without the
seventh or without the fourth, and the minor scale without
the sixth. The major scale with both the fourth and
the seventh omitted, in other words the pentatonic
scale, familiar in all primitive and exotic music as well
as in certain folk-tunes, notably the Celtic, is also present
in negro song. There are, moreover, examples in
the so-called whole-tone scale.</p>

<p>The effect produced by these aberrations constitutes
the most beautiful quality of negro music. We cannot
refrain from quoting here an example or two. The
raised sixth in the minor scale is most exquisitely
shown in the famous 'spiritual' 'You May Bury Me in
de Eas',' which we quote in full, without harmonization:<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

</div>


<p>Another instance is seen in the second section of
'Come Tremble-ing Down,' the first part of which is in
C major, turning into A minor with a striking disregard
of harmonic convention, and proceeding as follows:</p>


<figure class="figcenter illowe40_625" id="p292-score2_2">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>


<p>Such examples contain nothing that is imitative. Their
disregard for the natural progressions of diatonic melody
leave no doubt that the negro possessed, to begin
with, a wholly independent sense of tonality, which
sense he has in some measure retained or compromised.
As an instance of the minor seventh in the major scale
take 'A Great Camp Meetin'.' We quote only the last
three measures of the first section in order to establish
the key:</p>

<p>And, as a last example of tunes that have little in common
with any other kind of folk-song, a melody worthy
of the sophistication of an ultra-modern composer, let
us add 'O'er the Crossing':</p>

<p>There are many, many more.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Melodic imagination
of a high order would be required to produce consciously
such melodies as these. There is in them little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>that is trivial, nothing that is frivolous. Even the
'rhythmic snap' never sounds cheap in true negro music,
as distinct from worthless imitations and so-called
popular music—'coon songs' and the like. Note the following
as a noble example of its use:</p>

<p>In summing up the melodic and rhythmic characteristics
of negro tunes we may state the apparently
contradictory fact that the great majority of them are
in the major mode, notwithstanding their almost ever-present
note of sadness. Out of 527 songs analyzed by
Mr. Krehbiel 416 are in ordinary major, only 62 in ordinary
minor, 23 'mixed and vague,' and 111 pentatonic.
Herein the negro folk-song differs from most
other folk-songs. Its Southern habitat would, of course,
seem to predispose it to major, and thus it bears out
the argument in favor of climatic influence. Nevertheless
the effect of sadness in the melodies does not escape
us. Often it is produced by the aberrations of
which we have spoken; but more often it is less tangible.
In the words of Dr. DuBois 'these songs are the
music of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment;
and they tell of death and suffering and
unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings
and hidden ways.'</p>

<p>Practically all of the songs are in duple and quadruple
rhythm, triple time is extremely rare. The rhythmic
propulsion is always strong. The persistent excitement
of rhythm is evidently an African relic and
the sense of it is so strong as to overcome the natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
tendencies of the text. 'The negroes keep exquisite
time,' says Mr. Allen, 'and do not suffer themselves to
be daunted by any obstacle in the words. The most
obstinate hymns they will force to do duty with any
tune they please and will dash heroically through a
trochaic tune at the head of a column of iambs with
wonderful skill.'</p>

<p>The form of the songs is, of course, determined by
the structure of the verse. They are composed of simple
two-and four-bar phrases. Four such usually make
up a stanza, while four more are comprised in the
'chorus' often placed at the beginning of the song and
repeated after every verse. The stanzas of the older
songs commonly contain an alternating solo and refrain;
the second and fourth lines are usually given to
the refrain and the first and third to the verse, the third
being often a repetition of the first. In some cases
the refrain occupies three lines and the verse the remaining
one. 'The refrain is repeated with each
stanza,' says Mr. Allen concerning the manner of performance,
'the words of the verse are changed at the
pleasure of the leader, or fugleman, who sings either
well-known words, or, if he is gifted that way invents
verses as the song goes on.'<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Some difficulty was experienced by those who have
transcribed the music of the negroes in reproducing
'the entire character' of the songs by the conventional
symbols of the art. This is due in part to the primitive
elements in the music, and in part to the peculiar manner
of the performance. The characteristic improvisational
style of the negro, the peculiar quality of the
voices, and the slurring of certain values are all necessary
in order to produce the proper effect. Moreover,
the improvised harmony, simple as it was, had become
an inherent part of the music not easily to be reproduced.
The following description, taken from 'Slave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>Songs in the United States,' may be illuminating in this
connection:</p>

<p>'There is no singing in <em>parts</em>, as we understand it,
and yet no two appear to be singing the same thing;
the leading singer starts the words of each verse, often
improvising, and the others who "base" him, as it is
called, strike in with the refrain, or even join in the
solo when the words are familiar. When the "base"
begins the leader often stops, leaving the rest of the
words to be guessed at, or it may be they are taken up
by one of the other singers. And the "basers" themselves
seem to follow their own whims, beginning when
they please and leaving off when they please, striking
an octave above or below (in case they have pitched
the tune too high), or hitting some other note that
"chords," so as to produce the effect of a marvellous
complication and variety and yet with the most perfect
time and variety, and yet rarely with any discord. And
what makes it all the harder to unravel a thread of
melody out of this strange network is that, like birds,
they seem not infrequently to strike sounds that cannot
be precisely represented by the gamut and abound
in "slides" from one note to another and turns and
cadences not in articulated notes.'</p>

<p>A word should be added here regarding the instruments
used by the negro. The one most closely identified
with him is, of course, the banjo, which, in a primitive
form, he is said to have brought from Africa. The
'banjar' to which Thomas Jefferson refers in his 'Notes
on Virginia' was an instrument of four strings, or perhaps
less at first, whose head was covered with a rattlesnake's
skin, and which resembled closely an instrument
used by the Chinese. (<em>Cf.</em> Vol. I, p. 54.) It is
thought that the original banjo was a melodic rather
than a harmonic instrument, which is the peculiar office
of its modern off-spring, and, since the negro's music
was at first purely melodic, it must have been accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
played. The tuning, too, was probably very
different from that of the banjo of to-day.</p>

<p>Besides this, the negro's chief instrument was the
drum, as already indicated. There were two principal
sizes, made of a hollowed log (the smaller one often
of bamboo sections) over the end of which sheep or
goat skin was stretched. These drums were played in a
horizontal position, the player sitting on the instrument
astride. Then there were rattles, some like the Indians',
some consisting of a jaw-bone of an animal,
across which a piece of metal was 'rasped'; also the
<em>morimbabrett</em>, consisting of a small shallow box of thin
wood, with several sections of reed, of graduated
lengths, placed across it, the ends of which were
plucked by the player. The familiar Pan's pipes, made
from two joints of brake cane ('quills') and various
noise instruments—'bones,' triangle, tambourine, and
whistles—were all made to do duty. But when the negro
had become thoroughly civilized the violin became
his favorite instrument, and the 'technique' he achieved
upon it without any real training has often astonished
the white listener.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Attention was not directed to the value of negro songs
till the middle of the nineteenth century. Considerable
research resulted finally in the publication of several
collections, of which the 'Slave Songs of the United
States,' already mentioned above, was the first. This
collection of songs represents every phase in the gamut
of expression. The so-called 'sorrow' songs, the oldest
surviving negro songs, are perhaps the most expressive.
Some of them have sprung from the memories of a
single act of cruelty, or an event of such tragedy as to
create a really deep impression. Others echo simply
the hardships encountered day by day. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
songs, too, that reflect the sunshine and gaiety that was
not altogether foreign to plantation life, but those inspired
by grief are the most beautiful. Then there are
the 'occupational' songs suggested by the rhythm of
labor which form a part of every kind of folk-song the
world over. The value of such songs was fully recognized
by the slaves' masters, for they were unfailing
accelerators of labor, and it is known that the slaves
who led the singing in the field were given special rewards.
In consequence of this the negroes generally
came to abhor that class of songs, and it is significant
that very few of the 'corn songs,' 'reel tunes,' 'fiddle
songs,' and 'devil songs' have been preserved, while
hundreds of the religious songs—'spirituals,' etc.—are
now common property.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>A special class of labor songs were the so-called 'railroad
songs,' which originated during the Civil War,
when negroes were employed in building earth works
and fortifications. They consisted of a series of rhythmic,
protracted chants, upon words usually originated
by a leader. Railroad tracks were laid to these same
strains—hence their name. Their originality of thought
and the fact that they represent the last spontaneous
outburst of the negro under rapidly changing conditions,
lends them a special interest. The railroad itself
naturally stimulated the negro's imagination. He introduced
it metaphorically even in his religious songs:
the Christian was a traveller, the Lord was the conductor
and the ministers were the brakemen. At gospel
stations the train stopped for those that were saved,
or to supply the engine with the water of life. All of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>the negro's power of imagery was here brought into
play.</p>

<p>The love songs of the negro are few and those few
lack depth, and sometimes border on frivolity. An exception
is usually made for 'Poor Rosy,' concerning
which one old negress has said that 'it cannot be sung
without a full heart and troubled spirit.'</p>

<p>We have already pointed out the preponderance of
religious songs in the folk-music of the negro. The
reason is not hard to find. In his aboriginal home religious
rite, music and dance were closely associated,
as they are in the life of all primitive peoples. The
African's religion was a form of idolatry known as
voodooism. Connected with it were certain chants and
rites, relics of which have long survived.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> These primitive
rites were calculated to excite the emotions rather
than to uplift the spirit and under this excitement the
negro gave voice to the music that was in him. He
accepted the Christian religion as a substitute just as he
accepted the English language as a substitute for his
African tongue. He garbled both. He considered the
new religion not in a dogmatic, philosophical, or ethical
sense, but rather as an emotional experience. When
under religious excitement he would wander through
the woods in swamps much like the ancient Bacchantes.
'A race imbued with strong religious sentiment,' says
Mr. M. A. Haskell,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> 'one rarely finds among them an
adult who has not gone through that emotional experience
known as conversion, after which it is considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>vanity and sinfulness to indulge in song other than of a
sacred character.'</p>

<p>His religion became the negro's one relief, comfort,
and enjoyment. His daily life became tinged with his
belief; in his very sufferings he saw the fulfillments of
its promises. Nothing but patience for this life, nothing
but triumph in the next—that was the tenor of his lay.
Emancipation he thought of in terms of ultimate salvation
rather than earthly freedom. Thus he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'Children, we shall all be free,<br>
Children, we shall all be free,<br>
Children, we shall all be free,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the Lord shall appear.'</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A religious allegory colored nearly all his songs, a
pathetic, childlike trust in the supernatural spoke
through them, and biblical references, echoes of the
'meetin',' shreds of the minister's teaching, were strewn
indiscriminately through all of them. 'The rolling of
Jordan's waters, the sound of the last trumpet, the
vision of Jacob's ladder, the building of the ark, Daniel
in the lion's den, Ezekiel's wheel in the middle of a
wheel, Elijah's chariot of fire, the breaking up of the
Universe, the lurid pictures of the Apocalypse—all
asked for swelling proclamation.' Analogies between
the chosen people and their own in bondage were inevitable—and
'Hallelujahs' seemed as appropriate in
secular songs as in spiritual ones.</p>

<p>Often biblical words were garbled into mere nonsense.
Thus 'Jews crucified him' became 'Jews, screws,
defidum,' etc. The personality of the Prince of Darkness
assumed a degree of reality which reminds us of
the characters of mediæval miracle plays. One of the
songs personifies him thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'O Satan comes, like a busy ole man,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hal-ly, O hal-ly, O hal-lelu!</span><br>
He gets you down at de foot o' de hill,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hal-ly, O hal-ly, O hal-lelu!'</span> </p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>

<p>The so-called spirituals ('sper'chels) hold perhaps
the largest place in the negro's sacred repertory.
These plantation songs—'spontaneous outbursts of intense
religious fervor'—had their origin chiefly in the
camp-meetings, the revivals, and other religious exercises.
'They breathe a childlike faith in a personal
Father and glow with the hope that the children of
bondage will ultimately pass out of the wilderness into
the land of freedom.' To them belong such gems as
'You May Bury Me in the Eas',' the plaintive 'Nobody
Knows de Trouble I see,' the tender 'Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot,' and many others as rare.</p>

<p>At meetings the spirituals were often accompanied
by a most extraordinary form of religious ceremony,
namely the so-called 'shouts,' which flourished particularly
in South Carolina and south of it during antebellum
days.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The spirituals sung in this connection
were consequently called 'shout songs' or 'running
spirituals.' The shouts were veritable religious orgies,
or bacchanalia, and no doubt represent a relic of an
African custom. Julien Tiersot refers to them as 'dishevelled
dances.'<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> A vivid description of a shout is
given by a writer in 'The Nation' of May 30, 1867:</p>

<p>'... The "shout" takes place on Sundays, or on
"praise" nights throughout the week, and either in the
praise-house or in some cabin in which a regular religious
meeting has been held. Very likely more than half
the population of a plantation is gathered together.
Let it be the evening, and a light fire burns red before
the door of the house and on the hearth. For sometime
one hears, though at a good distance, a vociferous
exhortation or prayer of the presiding elder or of the
brother who has a gift that way and is not "on the back
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>seat"—a phrase the interpretation of which is "under
the censure of the church authorities for bad behavior"—and
at regular intervals one hears the elder "deaconing"
a hymn-book hymn, which is sung two lines at a
time and whose wailing cadences, borne on the night
air, are indescribably melancholy.</p>

<p>'But the benches are pushed back to the wall when
the formal meeting is over, and old and young, men
and women, sprucely dressed young men, grotesquely
half-clad field hands—the women generally with gay
handkerchiefs twisted about their heads and with short
skirts—boys with tattered shirts and men's trousers,
young girls barefooted, all stand up in the middle of
the floor, and when the "sperichil" is struck up begin
first walking and by and by shuffling around, one after
the other, in a ring. The foot is hardly taken from the
floor, and the progression is mainly due to a jerking,
twitching motion which agitates the entire shouter and
soon brings out streams of perspiration. Sometimes
they dance silently, sometimes as they shuffle they sing
the chorus of the spiritual, and sometimes the song itself
is sung by the dancers. But more frequently a
band, composed of some of the best singers and of tired
shouters, stand at the side of the room to "base" the
others, singing the body of the song and clapping their
hands together on the knees. Song and dance are alike
extremely energetic, and often, when the shout lasts
into the middle of the night, the monotonous thud, thud
of the feet prevents sleep within half a mile of the
praise house.'</p>

<p>Closely related to the shout songs are the funeral
songs which accompanied the 'wakes' and burials of
the negroes. They were sung in a low monotonous
croon by those who 'sat up' and are particularly noted
for their irregularity in everything except rhythm. The
negroes are especially inclined to voice their sorrow in
nocturnal song, as their savage ancestors did before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
them, and likewise they indulged in funeral dances at
night. Mrs. Jeanette Robinson Murphy, writing in 'The
Independent,' speaks of a custom in which hymns are
sung at the deathbed to become messengers to loved
ones gone before and which the departing soul is
charged to bear to heaven. 'When a woman dies some
friend or relative will kneel down and sing to the soul
as it takes flight. One of these songs contains endless
verses, conveying remembrances to relatives in glory.'
Often these funeral songs convey deep emotion in a
nobly poetic vein. An example recorded by Colonel
Thomas Wentworth Higginson has the following
words:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'I know moonlight, I know starlight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I lay dis body down.</span><br>
I walk in de moonlight, I walk in de starlight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I lay dis body down.</span><br>
I know de graveyard, I know de graveyard,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I lay dis body down.</span><br>
I walk in de graveyard, I walk troo de graveyard,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fo lay dis body down.</span><br>
I lay in de grave, and stretch out my arm;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I lay dis body down.</span><br>
I go to de judgment in de evenin' of de day,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I lay dis body down,</span><br>
An' my soul an' your soul will meet in de day<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I lay dis body down.'</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>'Never, it seems to me,' comments Col. Higginson,
'since man first lived and suffered, was his infinite longing
for peace uttered more plaintively than in that line.'
There are many other examples of such funeral songs
preserved; some of them Mr. Krehbiel has reprinted in
his 'Afro-American Folksongs' (pp. 100 ff.).</p>

<p>Few of the secular songs have survived. Even these,
it seems, were often made to do service in the religious
meeting, on the Wesleyan principle that it would not
do to let the devil have all the good tunes. Some songs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
on the other hand, were used to accompany rowing as
well as 'shouting'—probably because of the similarity
of the rhythm in the two motions. In 'Michael, Row the
Boat Ashore,' which was a real boat-song, not a human
Michael but the archangel himself was meant. Other
tunes used for rowing were 'Heav'n Bell a-ring',' 'Jine
'em,' 'Rainfall,' 'No Man,' and 'Can't stay behin'.' Similarly,
other spirituals were used as working songs, for
their rhythms were hardly ever sluggish. As a good
specimen of purely secular songs—'the strange barbaric
songs that one hears upon the Western steamboats'—Mr.
W. F. Allen points to the following:</p>

<p>The negro's natural impulse for dancing seems to
have found its outlet in the 'shout,' as far as the Atlantic
seaboard states are concerned at least, for the Christian
sects promptly stamped out the dances which were
connected with primitive superstition. In Louisiana,
however, the negro came in contact with a very different
sort of people, the Spanish and French settlers—southern
races of a more sensuous turn than the Anglo-Saxon.
The musical result was the superposition of
Spanish and French melody over negro rhythms—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
two ingredients of the Creole folk-songs, which are to a
large extent dance songs.</p>

<p>The warlike and lascivious dances of the African
took on a more civilized form under the influence of
Spanish and French culture, though they are said in
some cases to have remained licentious enough. But
the product has been highly influential musically. Thus
the fascinating Habañera, the familiar rhythm of many
a Spanish melody, is, according to Albert Friedenthal,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
of negro origin. As its name indicates, Havana was its
home and from there it spread to all Spanish and Portuguese
America, the West Indies, Central and South
America. 'Extended and complicated rhythms are
known only where the negroes are to be found,' says
our investigator. Mr. Krehbiel quotes a creole song
from Martinique, built upon the Habañera rhythm, entitled
<em>Tant sirop est doux</em>, and speaks of Afro-American
songs in which the characteristic rhythm is so persistently
used as to suggest that they were influenced
by a subconscious memory of the old dance. Other
dances of negro origin, mentioned by writers on the
Antilles, are the Bamboula, Bouèné, Counjai, Kalinda,
Bélé, Bengume, Babouille, Cata, and Guiouba. The
term 'juba' applied to the plucking accompaniments of
negro dance-songs in minstrel shows may be a derivative
of the last.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Creole we must emphasize that
the word is not properly applied to any persons of
mixed stock, as has been frequently done. Creole is
a word of Spanish etymology and was used to denote
the pure-blooded Spanish or French native of the
American colonies. But it is the negro slaves of these
creoles—whom we may call black creoles (including
mulattoes, quadroons, etc.)—that created the charming
songs breathing the spirit of the tepid zone along the
great gulf and the Father of Waters. They, too, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>the creators of the <em>patois</em> to which the songs are set.
Concerning the origin of this <em>patois</em> Mr. Krehbiel gives
some interesting details: 'The creole patois, though
never reduced to writing by its users, is still a living
language. It is the medium of communication between
black nurses and their charges in the French families
of Louisiana to-day, and half a century ago it was exclusively
spoken by French creoles up to the age of ten
or twelve years. In fact, children had to be weaned
from it with bribes or punishment. It was, besides,
the language which the slave spoke to his master and
the master to him. The need which created it was the
same as that which created the corrupt English of the
slaves in other parts of the country.... Thus, then,
grew the pretty language, soft in the mouth of the
creole as <em>bella lingua in bocca toscana</em>, in which the
creole sang of his love, gave rhythmical impulse to the
dance, or scourged with satire those who fell under his
displeasure.'</p>

<p>The Creole songs, according to Lafcadio Hearn, are
'Frenchy in construction but possess a few African
characteristics of method.' 'There could neither have
been creole patois nor creole melodies but for the
French and Spanish blooded slaves of Louisiana and
the Antilles. The melancholy, quavering beauty and
weirdness of the negro chant are lightened by the
French influence, subdued and deepened by the Spanish.'
Unlike the negro slave of the Virginias and Carolinas,
etc., who poured out all his emotion in gospel
hymn and spirituals, the black creole was especially
fond of love-songs—crooning love songs in the soft,
pretty words of his patois—some sad, some light-hearted.
One is 'the tender lament of one who was
the evil of his heart's choice the victim of chagrin in
beholding a female rival wearing those vestments of
extra quality that could only be the favors which both
women had courted from the hand of some proud master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
whence alone such favors could come.'<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Another,
'Caroline,' reveals the romance and the tragedy of the
dramatic life of the young creole slaves. We quote it
here, as our one example of creole tunes:</p>

<p>In general, the love song of the black Creole is more
distinctive than that of other Afro-Americans. A famous
example is 'Layotte,' utilized by Louis Moreau
Gottschalk (b. New Orleans, 1829, of French and English
parentage), who achieved international fame both
as pianist and composer. Gottschalk did much to make
the charm of Creole melodies known to the world. The
themes of his piano pieces perpetuate many of these
melodies, among them <em>Avant, grenadier</em>, which forms
the theme of one of his earliest compositions, <em>Bananier</em>.
The popularity of Gottschalk and the general interest
which his music aroused in Paris and elsewhere was
one of the sensations of the musical world of that day.</p>

<p>Another class of lyrics peculiar to the Creoles were
the satirical songs which may be a survival of a primitive
practice brought by their ancestors from America.
At carnival times scores of these songs make their appearance—or
reappearance,—new and topical words
being applied to the old tunes, and public as well as
personal grudges are taken out in this manner. Such
songs are <em>Musieu Bainjo</em>, a mild bit of pleasantry leveled
at a darkey who 'put on airs,' and <em>Michié Préval</em>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>of which Mr. Cable says that for generations the man
of municipal politics was fortunate who escaped entirely
a lampooning set to its air. 'Its swinging and
incisive rhythm made it the most effective vehicle for
satire which the Creole folk-song has ever known.'
(Krehbiel.) In Martinique these satirical songs, or <em>pillards</em>,
are more malicious in intent and often cruel in
the relentless public castigation they inflict upon the
objects of their makers' hate.</p>

<p>Other creole songs are of a historical nature, recording
events or episodes of importance to the community.
The invasion of Louisiana by the British in 1814, and
the capture of New Orleans by the Union forces in
1862, for instance, were thus chronicled.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The musical value and the charm of negro songs were
little appreciated until the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University,
Tenn., made their famous tour, which began
in October, 1871. George L. White, the treasurer of
the school—one of the institutions for the education of
the blacks that came under the patronage of the American
Missionary Association—desirous of raising funds
for its maintenance, was struck with the artistic possibilities
of the little choir of students which he had organized
and trained. After several successful concerts
held in nearby towns he embarked upon a grand tour
of the country, with the object of raising a fund of
$20,000. The little company of emancipated slaves—at
no time more than fourteen strong—gave the world so
remarkable a demonstration of the musical qualities of
their race that the matter has hardly been called into
question since. In less than three years, moreover, they
brought back to Fisk University nearly $100,000. Their
adventures are told in detail by J. B. T. Marsh, who, in
his 'Story of the Jubilee Singers,' says in part: 'They
were turned away from hotels and driven out of railroad
waiting rooms because of their color. But they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
had been received with honor by the President of the
United States, they had sung their slave songs before
the Queen of Great Britain, and they had gathered as
invited guests about the breakfast-table of her Prime
Minister. Their success was as remarkable as their
mission was unique!</p>

<p>The climax of their tour was the participation in the
World's Peace Jubilee held in Boston in June-July, 1872.
There, before an audience of 40,000 people gathered
from all parts of the country, they sang themselves into
the hearts of the nation, in spite of a recurrence of race
prejudice. Their singing of Julia Ward Howe's 'Battle
Hymn of the Republic' to the tune of 'John Brown' was,
according to Mr. Marsh, 'as if inspired.' 'When the
grand old chorus "Glory, Hallelujah" followed with a
swelling volume of music from the great orchestra, the
thunder of the bands and the roar of artillery, the scene
was indescribable. Twenty thousand people were on
their feet. Ladies waved their handkerchiefs, men
threw their hats in the air and the Coliseum rang with
the cheers and shouts of "the Jubilees, the Jubilees, forever!"'</p>

<p>The fame of the 'Jubilees' soon spread abroad, and,
responding to a demand, they appeared in England,
Scotland, and Ireland, with extraordinary success.
Their appeal was direct to the hearts of the people, and
an echo of it is preserved to this day in the adoption
of at least one melody as an English Sunday-school
hymn. A second tour took the colored singers into
Holland, Switzerland, and Germany as well, and everywhere
they met with the deepest appreciation. Received
by the sovereigns of both Holland and Germany,
they were given the use of the Dutch cathedrals and
the Berlin Domkirche for their concerts. The Berlin
<em>Musikzeitung</em> indulged in a long laudatory article concerning
their music and the artistic finish of their singing,
and Franz Abt, the composer, acknowledged their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
work in the following remark: 'We could not even
take our German peasant and reach in generations of
culture such results in art, conduct, and character as
appear in these freed slaves.'</p>

<p>Other musicians have from time to time called the
world's attention to the value of negro music. Most
prominent among them being Dr. Antonin Dvořák,
who, during his stay in America, voiced his admiration
of it and made use of the material in several of his best
known compositions, notably the 'New World Symphony'
and the 'American Quartet.' It will be appropriate
to add in conclusion the well-known passage
from Dr. Dvořák's article in the 'Century Magazine' of
February, 1895, which has caused so much comment:</p>

<p>'A while ago I suggested that inspiration for truly
national music might be derived from the negro melodies
or Indian chants. I was led to take the view partly
by the fact that the so-called plantation songs are indeed
the most striking and appealing melodies that
have been found on this side of the water, but largely
by observation that this seems to be recognized, though
often unconsciously, by most Americans. All races
have their distinctive national songs which they at once
recognize as their own, even if they have never heard
them before. It is a proper question to ask, what
songs, then, belong to the American and appeal more
strikingly to him than any others? What melody will
stop him on the street, if he were in a strange land, and
make the home feeling well up within him, no matter
how hardened he might be, or how wretchedly the
tunes were played? Their number, to be sure, seems to
be limited. The most potent, as well as the most beautiful
among them, according to my estimation, are certain
of the so-called plantation melodies and slave
songs, all of which are distinguished by unusual and
subtle harmonies, the thing which I have found in no
other songs but those of Scotland and Ireland.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>Many American composers have, since these lines
were written, acted upon the suggestion contained in
them. We need but mention George W. Chadwick,
Henry Schoenefeld, E. R. Kroeger, Henry F. Gilbert,
Arthur Farwell, and W. H. Humiston among those who
have drawn upon this fertile treasure of thematic material.
It is but the beginning, however. American music
is becoming more and more distinctive. Whether
intentionally or spontaneously, our musical literature
is bound to absorb some of the color of so potent an
element of national lore.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A great deal cannot be said at this time about the
American folk-song from other than negro sources.
Doubtless there is a wealth of song to be found in the
Spanish-American sections along our borders, in the
recesses of the Blue Ridge mountains, whose communities
still live by the guide of primitive instincts and in
defiance of law and order; on the great prairies of the
west, where the cowboy has developed a rude type of
chivalry peculiar to himself and with it an idiom reflecting
the dare-devil and man-defying existence which
he leads. But little has been done to collect this scattered
store, to commit it to paper, and to sift the worthy
from the dross.</p>

<p>As regards the cowboy songs, the Southwest Society
of the Archæological Institute of America, under the direction
of Charles F. Lummis, has recently done some
pioneer work. One of the songs thus gathered, 'The
Lone Prairie,' was harmonized by Mr. Arthur Farwell
and published in the Wa-wan Press series in 1905. In
the arranger's opinion it is probably the first cowboy
song to be printed. As such it acquires a special interest.
It is in the minor mode, has the rhythmic snap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
peculiar to negro music, though it is in triple rhythm,
and acquires a certain exotic flavor by the constant use
of the minor seventh instead of the leading tone. Its
outstanding ethnic character, if it has any, is, however,
Irish. It is not improbable that the cowboy song should
have acquired a certain tone from the music of the Indian,
though a generous admixture of the Celtic idiom
is most certainly to be expected from the racial character
of the caste.</p>

<p>In the same number of the Wa-wan Press there are
two examples of Spanish-Californian folk-songs that
are extremely interesting. Their Spanish character is
unmistakable, though perhaps the tone is a little more
plaintive than we are wont to expect from their original
Southern habitat. 'The Hours of Grief' and 'The Black
Face' are both set in the minor, and the 2/4 (quasi 6/8)
measure, with the characteristic dotted rhythm, only
accentuates the sombreness of the sentiment. Syncopation
is used sparingly, at the end of a phrase only.
The subject of the latter song—the lament of a dusky
youth over his unhappy love for a white beauty, would
bespeak negro origin, too, and the general character of
the piece is certainly reminiscent of the Creole dance
songs with their Habañera rhythm.</p>

<p>The Spanish-American songs of further south, of
Central America and Mexico, hardly come within our
scope, though American composers would be quite
justified in drawing upon them for material. A collection
recently made by Miss Eleanor Hague, of the American
Folklore Society, and published with accompaniments
by Edward Kilenyi, does not reveal much beyond
the standard of salon music, though in their own home
the characteristic environment of Spanish America and
the peculiar manner of their performance may add
greatly to their effect. To quote Miss Hague:</p>

<p>'To sit in the plaza of some quaint Mexican town on
a starry perfumed evening is to realize the significance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
of highly colored and impassioned utterance. One's
blood is fired by the rhythmic quality of the music
which floats out from the gaily lighted central pavilion,
and the groups of people are a delight to one's eyes:
Indians in white cotton clothes, gaudy <em>serapes</em> and
big hats; groups of young girls with scarfs over their
heads walking about; other groups of young men in
the picturesque <em>charro</em> costume, as well as occasional
older people of dignified mien. On a bench an exquisitely
pretty girl sits beside her mother, with her eyes
fixed on space, but quite conscious of the youth in his
best embroidered jacket and sombrero, at the further
end of the bench, who gazes shyly at her and then
looks away with rapture in his eyes. If he has not
already begun to "play the bear" under her window
he undoubtedly will soon reach that point in his courtship.... In
Mexico the guitar is used everywhere for
accompanying and also for solos. As a rule in playing
accompaniments the natives content themselves with
simple harmonies in chord form or as arpeggios; but
they have a deep affection for successions of thirds and
never seem to tire of their honied sweetness.'</p>

<p>The French-Canadian, across the other border of the
United States, also has developed a folk-song peculiar
to himself in the course of his romantic existence.
It is so closely allied to French folk-song that we have
preferred to treat it in that connection. There remains
only to be mentioned the folk-song of the Kentucky
mountaineer which has had some attention at
the hands of Mrs. Jeannette Robinson Murphy, already
quoted above. The mountaineer, like the cowboy, is
made up of various national strains, and his song in
consequence is one of mixed or indefinite character.
The rhythmic element again predominates and, indeed,
practically all his songs have their principal use in
connection with the dance. Fast rhythmic tunes in
duple time and in very simple form are sung as accompaniment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
to all the so-called 'set dances,' which form
the chief entertainment at evening gatherings in log
cabins. Upon these occasions the fiddler assumes the
office of leader for both song and dance—he calls out
the tunes, directs the 'figures' and sings the first verse
of the song, while his assistant, by a peculiar tapping
of the strings of the instrument, marks the rhythm.
The songs, or ballads, are often of humorous or bantering
flirtatious character, and in them is perpetuated
many a peculiarity of mountaineer life.</p>

<p>At this point we end our necessarily incomplete review
of American folk-song, a subject which future research
will do much to place more nearly within our
reach. We shall now discuss briefly the American song
in the folk manner, which may be considered to have
grown out of the folk-song proper.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>About the year 1830 an American comedian, W. D.
Rice (1808-1860), popularly known as 'Daddy' Rice,
stood in a stable in Louisville, Ky., and watched an old,
deformed and decrepit negro singing a lively tune to
words something like these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'Come, listen all you gals an' boys,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'se jes' from Tuckyhoe;</span><br>
I'm goin' to sing a little song,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My name's Jim Crow</span><br>
Weel about and turn about and do jes' so;<br>
Eb'ry time I weel about I jump, Jim Crow'—</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>and a number of other verses recounting the wondrous
adventures of 'Jim Crow.' They are not very exciting,
to be sure, and their humor hardly appeals to our
jaded minds to-day. The tune, too, is mediocre enough.
But 'Daddy' Rice saw a great opportunity. He learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
the song and sang it, accompanied by all the funny
turns and motions of the old negro and many more.
Soon after he was appearing in a theatre in Pittsburgh,
and, meeting a negro porter on the way, took him to
the theatre, borrowed his clothes, donned them, blackened
his face with cork and added a black wig of matted
moss. When he appeared on the stage and sang
'Jim Crow' the audience roared with laughter; but when
he added topical verses of his own and made his antics
still funnier, the house went wild. To add to the mirth,
Cuff, the negro, whose professional services were in
demand, came on to the stage in négligé and frantically
expostulated to reclaim his clothes. Of course, the
audience mistook the interruption for part of the
'show' and the signal for a climax of hilarity.</p>

<p>That was the birth of 'Negro Minstrelsy'—a type of
entertainment which for the greater part of the century
was one of the chief delights of the American public.
How much, or little, of it was 'negro' matters little—the
original impulse, at any rate, came from that source,
and the rich opportunities for humor—of an innocent
sort—to be gotten out of lampooning the race, were
eagerly exploited. The 'dandy darky,' the character
created by Rice, soon became a stock article of the
common show and he made his way to every stage.
The 'cork fraternity,' as one of its members called the
profession, enlarged rapidly and soon numbered many
distinguished representatives. Joe Jefferson himself
made his début in that capacity at the tender age of
four, when he emerged from a bag on 'Daddy' Rice's
shoulders. As for 'Daddy' himself, he added song after
song to his répertoire, until there were enough for several
evenings' entertainment. He toured not only
America but England as well and acquired a considerable
fortune.</p>

<p>He was, by the way, not the first to 'blacken his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
professionally.' From Charley White's diary<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> we learn
that already in 1799 'Mr. Graupner' did so, 'Pot Pie
Herbert' in 1814, Andrew Jackson Allen in 1815, etc.,
etc. In that year, indeed, according to Mr. Krehbiel,
a song description of the battle of Plattsburg was sung
in a drama to words supposedly in negro dialect. But
organized negro minstrelsy did not exist until 1843,
when Frank Brown, Billy Whitlock, Dick Pelham, and
Dan D. Emmett appeared in the Chatham Square Theatre,
New York, as the Virginia Minstrels and were 'received
with deafening applause.' They were soon followed
by band after band and hence transferred their
labors to England to escape competition. When they
returned there were the 'Kentucky Minstrels,' 'Congo
Minstrels,' 'Original Virginia Serenaders,' 'African Serenaders,'
and many more, among them the famous
Christy's Minstrels, organized in 1844 or 1845.</p>

<p>The droll humor of the negro, his native wit and
ludicrous ways were a rich field for travesty to draw
upon. Exaggerated, burlesqued in showman fashion,
it was the joy of audiences still fond of slap-stick comedy.
But the pathetic side of negro existence, told in
sentimental ballad and stories of plantation life, appealed
as well. No less a person than Thackeray was
affected by it. According to the famous author's own
testimony, it 'moistened his spectacles in a most unexpected
manner.'</p>


<p>From a mere accessory to the performance the negro
minstrel show, thanks to the ingenuity of Edwin T.
Christy, spread itself to usurp the entire evening.
Christy created the form, the stereotype, as it were, of
the minstrel show. He provided for a first part during
which the performers, from four to twenty in number,
seated in a single row with the 'interlocutor' in the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
and 'bones' and 'tambo' at either end, engaged in
repartee and song in negro dialect alternately. During
the second part or 'olio' there were banjo playing, clog
dancing, and other 'specialties.' It might be remarked
here that the negro minstrel developed a style of instrumentalism
all his own, consisting largely of violin and
banjo playing, often in trick fashion, between the knees,
over the head, behind the back, etc. The third part of
the minstrel show degenerated into a musical variety
entertainment as far removed from plantation life as
possible.</p>

<p>Increased virtuosity notwithstanding, this breaking
away from the negro traditions of the old minstrelsy
brought about decay. Gorgeous show and glitter superseded
negro characterization, just as the coon song took
the place of the negro ditty, while only the blackened
faces recalled the original intent of the entertainment.
At present the minstrel show is dead except in amateur
circles of the country town.</p>

<p>But it has served its purpose. It has created a stock
of songs which, though not strictly folk-tunes, are so
nearly so as to find a legitimate place in this chapter.
Only indirectly were they influenced by the negro; their
composers were the minstrels themselves—the minstrels
of fifty years ago, who constitute as unique a type as has
existed in America. Indeed, they wrote the greater part
of the 'popular music' of their day. Their entertainment
called for a distinct and peculiar type of songs
and the supplying of this demand called into play
much genuine talent, though the showman was sadly
deficient in musical grammar. His first models were
probably the negro folk-songs with their stanza and
chorus, the former a simple melody, the latter in improvised
harmony. 'The melodies which were more
direct progenitors of the songs which Christy's minstrels
and other minstrel companies carried all over
the land were attributed to the Southern negroes; songs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
like "Coal Black Rose," "Zip Coon,"<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and "Ole Virginny
Nebber Tire" have always been accepted as the creation
of the blacks,' says Mr. Krehbiel, 'though I do not
know whether or not they really are.'</p>

<p>Most of the names of minstrel composers are now
forgotten; B. R. Hanby, the author of 'Ole Shady'; Eastburn,
who wrote 'The Little Brown Jug'; the writers of
'Gentle Annie' and 'Rosa Lee, or Don't be Foolish, Joe,'
live on by their songs alone. But there are two names,
perhaps three, that stand out above the rest and should
be remembered as the names of composers. One of
them only was a minstrel, Dan Emmett, and one of his
inspirations has sufficed to make him immortal.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Many
other popular and original tunes flowed from his facile
pen—'Old Dan Tucker,' 'Early in the Morning,' etc.—but
none has achieved the fame of 'Dixie.' The second
famous writer of minstrel tunes, Stephen Foster, was
a composer who wrote in the minstrel style simply because
it was the prevailing style and because he found
a ready market for that sort of product. But, regardless
of the artistic value of that kind of music in general,
Foster must always be counted among the really great
American composers.</p>

<p>Stephen Collins Foster was born in Lawrenceburg,
now a part of Pittsburgh, Pa., on July 4, 1826. By instinct
and by inheritance he was a Southerner, for his
father had come from Virginia and his mother from
Maryland. Foster was not a professional musician;
he acted as bookkeeper for his brother, a prosperous
merchant of Pittsburgh, and got his inspiration at camp
meetings. He taught himself the flageolet, studied Mozart
and Weber assiduously, and acquired a knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>of French and German by his own efforts. He dabbled
in composition, turned out a 'Tioga Waltz' for four
flutes (!), and in 1842 wrote a song, 'Open thy Lattice,
Love,' to words by someone else. He and five friends
constituted themselves a little singing club and for this
he wrote many songs, including 'Oh, Susanna,' 'Old
Uncle Ned,' etc., in the style of the negro folk-song.
Though a German musician of Pittsburgh criticized his
work for him, he certainly had no real musical training.
By the advice of friends he devoted several years to
the voice and pianoforte, 'but he was afraid that too
much study would impair his originality! Hence, if
his harmonies are bald, his accompaniments empirical,
and his part writing unskilled, we need not wonder,
but only regret that so graceful a flower was not planted
in richer soil.'<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>After submitting 'Oh, Susannah' to a minstrel troupe
Foster adopted that style for most of his songs. There
are about one hundred and sixty in all, a small number
of them true gems, perhaps unsurpassed in their
way; many, especially the later ones, mere pot-boilers.
'The Old Folks at Home,' 'My Old Kentucky Home,'
'Massa's in de Cold, Cold Ground,' 'Old Black Joe,' are
practically immortal. They are to America what Silcher's
and Weber's songs are to Germany—they are
as simple and beautiful in their expression as they are
sincere in their sentiment. They were born of the impulse
of creation and it is to be remarked that this
applies to the text as well, for Foster wrote nearly all
of his own lyrics.</p>

<p>There are besides a number of sentimental ballads—'Nellie
Bly,' 'Nancy Tile,' 'Come where My Love Lies
Dreaming,' etc.—perhaps somewhat more artificial,
rather trivial in sentiment and certainly more German
than negro in their substance—and some comic pieces,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>such as 'The Camptown Races.' His last work was 'The
Beautiful Dream,' written in 1864.</p>

<p>Foster had a gentle, sweet nature, but lacking in self-discipline
and easily led. He was childlike in his sentiments,
possessed of a pathetic affection for his parents
and an almost maniacal love for his mother throughout
his life. He married at the age of twenty-eight,
but soon separated from his wife, became shiftless and
addicted to drink. Want drove him to rapid production—he
could write a song in the morning, sell it at
noon and spend the proceeds at night. Finally, he
found himself in New York, penniless, without employment
and in 1864 came to a tragic end in a cheap East
Side hotel at the age of thirty-three.</p>

<p>His life, with its grim romance, reminds one of the
career of that other American genius, Edgar Allan Poe.
Both were aristocrats of Southern antecedents and
made of the very essence of the American stock. Both
spoke in an idiom remarkably attuned to the best of
the American genius. Foster's melodies partake essentially
of the folk manner—they are <em>volkstümlich</em>—they
might have been folk-songs, except that they are individually
conceived, that their birth is legitimate, so to
speak. In the hearts of the people they rank as folk-songs,
and, their appeal being permanent, interesting
conclusions might be drawn from them as to the qualities
of the American national character.</p>

<p>The other non-minstrel composer whom we desire
to mention as a writer of popular tunes of the minstrel
type is Henry Clay Work (b. Middletown, Conn., 1832,
d. Hartford, Conn., 1882). Work also was not a trained
musician in the modern sense, but a musician of earnest
endeavor and sincere expression. Louis C. Elson
says 'he sounded the most characteristic note of all
the American composers of the time, and his songs
give almost every note in the gamut of expression, from
sarcasm to triumph, from gaiety to military glory.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span></p>

<p>The emancipation movement inspired Work in the
direction of pseudo-negro songs—'Kingdom Comin’'
and 'Babylon is Fallen' being the first of a series of contributions
to the music of the Civil War. Work's most
lasting success is, of course, 'Marching Through Georgia,'
which properly comes under the head of patriotic
songs.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>A type of folk-song that is as often appropriated as
it is indigenous is the patriotic song. It can be called
a folk-song only in the sense that the people sing it,
though in a measure it must reflect the character of the
people—in a measure only, for one nation is very much
like the other when fired by patriotism. Almost invariably,
however, such songs are created at times of
national stress, when feelings run high and poetic outbursts
come from unexpected quarters. Such are the
circumstances under which nearly all patriotic songs
were created, 'Yankee Doodle,' 'Hail Columbia,' 'The
Star Spangled Banner,' 'John Brown,' and 'Marching
Through Georgia' included. Some, like 'Dixie,' became
patriotic unintentionally, so to speak, and some,
like 'America,' were simply applications of foreign
tunes to native words.</p>

<p>The earliest American patriotic song, dating from
colonial days, was a 'Liberty Song,' the words of which
were written by Mrs. Mercy Warren, the wife of Mr.
James Warren, of Plymouth. The verses were as amateurish
as the music is angular and bombastic. It was
advertised in the 'Boston Chronicle' in 1768. Both the
advertisement and the song are reproduced in Elson's
'History of American Music' (pp. 140 ff.). The patriotism
reflected in the song is that of the Colonial:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'This bumper I crown for our sovereign's health:<br>
And this for Britannia's glory and wealth.<br>
That wealth and that glory immortal may be<br>
If she is but just and we are but free.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But after 1770 a new version appeared:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'Come swallow your bumpers, ye Tories and roar,<br>
That the sons of fair freedom are hampered once more,<br>
But know that no cut-throats our spirits can tame,<br>
Nor a host of oppressors shall smother the flame.'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the storm thus foreboded broke loose, the 'Liberty
Song' hardly sufficed to express people's feelings,
but there was nothing to take its place. To be sure, in
William Billings' 'Singing Master's Assistant' there were
printed two war songs that became very popular, especially
the one for which Billings himself composed the
words and set them to his favorite tune, 'Chester':</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'Let tyrants shake their iron rod,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And slavery clank her galling chains,</span><br>
We'll fear them not, we'll trust in God;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New England's God forever reigns,' etc., etc.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>'The enthusiasm with which Billings sang and taught
these songs communicated itself to the people, even to
those who in the prejudice of their time had strenuously
opposed singing in the churches, but no one could
doubt the composer's sincere patriotism.'<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Then there
were some stanzas, set to an old Scotch tune and sung
by the Pennsylvania regiments during the Revolution,
and a convivial soldiers' song, 'The Volunteer Boys,'
that was composed by Henry Archer, an Englishman, in
1778, and widely sung. But the one revolutionary tune
that has survived was, strange enough, originally a song
of derision aimed at the American troops by the British.
That tune is 'Yankee Doodle.' 'Yankee,' the term
still applied to Americans in general by Europeans,
but by Americans to New Englanders in particular, has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>a doubtful etymology. There is an Indian word 'yankoos,'
which means invincible, and a Cherokee word,
'eankke,' signifying coward or slave; 'kanokie,' or silent
man, was the name applied to Connecticut settlers by
the natives—according to 'Diedrich Knickerbocker'—and,
finally, there is 'yengeese,' an Indian corruption of
'English'—all possible roots of the word. There are
other plausible derivations, including one from the Norwegian
and others from the Scotch. The word 'doodle,'
too, has a Scotch meaning—'dudeln,' to play music.
For the origin of the combination 'Yankee Doodle,'
there are, as Mr. Sonneck puts it, 'whole genealogies
of theories.' Probably the words were not used before
1700. The first known mention of the song so entitled
is in a letter of April 26, 1776, in which it is called 'a
song composed in derision of New Englanders, scornfully
called Yankees.'</p>


<p>Many theories there are also regarding the origin of
the tune. Most of them, including the well-known
story of a British officer having composed it during the
Revolution, are impossible, while the claim of Dr. Richard
Schuchburgh<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> as its composer (at Albany in 1755)
is very doubtful. It is said to have been played by a
fife-major of the Grenadier Guards in 1750 as a march,
and a tune at least similar to it is supposed to have
been familiar to the English peasantry previous to the
time of Charles I. Whatever its origin, it was played
by the Americans at Burgoyne's surrender (Saratoga,
1777) and again at the surrender of Yorktown, at the
instance of Lafayette, who probably intended it as a
taunt. It was recognized officially as an American national
song at the signing of the treaty of Ghent (1814),
when the Flemish burghers serenaded the American
ambassadors with the tune, having learned it from
Henry Clay's servant!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span></p>
<p>'America,' sung to the same tune as 'God Save the
King'—a tune that has been variously appropriated by
other nations—had its American origin in the Park
Street Church, Boston, the words being written for a
children's celebration held on July 4, 1832, by the Rev.
Samuel F. Smith, a young theological student. Before
this, however, the tune had done service at different
times for 'God Save America,' 'God Save George
Washington,' and what not. The origin of the melody,
like that of many other good tunes, is shrouded in
mystery. It is generally attributed to Dr. John Bull
(b. 1563), who is supposed to have written it for a
banquet given to James I in 1607. But Mr. Sonneck
remarks that 'with such arguments [as Mr. Elson's comparisons]
the main theme of the last movement of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony would become very close
to being inspired by 'Yankee Doodle.'<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> After citing
many theories Mr. Elson remarks that 'there seems,
however, scarcely a doubt that Henry Carey, the composer
of "Sally in Our Alley," the unfortunate genius
who commited suicide after a blameless life of eighty
years, with a single half-penny in his pocket [in the
year 1740], was the author and composer of the great
anthem.'</p>

<p>Joseph Hopkinson (1770-1842), in a letter of August
24, 1840, throws light on the origin of 'Hail
Columbia,' another popular American patriotic song.
It was, according to him, originally a political song
rather than a national one. The tune is that of
the old 'President's March,' a leading work in
the early American répertoire, composed, some say,
by Johannes Roth, a German musician of Philadelphia,
popularly known as 'Old Roth,' in 1689,
but more probably by a certain Pheil, to whom it is
attributed in a copy of the year 1793, in the possession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>of the Library of Congress.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In 1798 Hopkinson wrote
new words for it, which were a glorification of President
Adams and Federalism. Sung by Hopkinson's
friend, Gilbert Fox, an actor, at a benefit performance,
it roused great enthusiasm and the audience joined in
the chorus. But the 'Aurora' of April 27,1798, called it
'a most ridiculous bombast and the vilest adulation of
the Anglo-monarchical party.' Since its use as a Federal
song 'Hail Columbia' has undergone a considerable
process of polishing, but its erstwhile popularity has
not by any means worn off.</p>

<p>'The Star Spangled Banner,' because of its exclusive
use and its inherent musical strength universally recognized
as <em>the</em> 'National Anthem' of America, is, like its
brothers, an imported article. The tune is that of an
old English drinking song, 'To Anacreon in Heaven,'
written by the president of the Anacreontic Society in
London about 1770-75. The music is, in all likelihood,
by John Stafford Smith (1750-1836), also a member of
the society and author of the <em>Musica Antiqua</em> (1832).
Its American use dates from 1798, when Robert Treat
Paine, whose real name was Thomas Paine, but who
objected to being confused with the 'atheist' Paine,
adopted it to words of his own, under the title of 'Adams
and Liberty, the Boston Patriotic Song.' Other versions,
such as 'Jefferson and Liberty,' appeared for
various occasions, one even to celebrate the Russian
victory over Napoleon! But the real version, the one
we know to-day, was born during the War of 1812 under
conditions which fire the patriot's imagination.</p>

<p>The story is well known. Francis Scott Key, the
author of the words, was sent to the British Fleet in
Chesapeake Bay as the envoy of President Madison to
request the release of a non-combatant citizen held as
prisoner. As the bombardment of Fort Henry was to
take place that day, the British commander retained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>Key till there was no fear of divulging the British plans.
On the morning of Sept 14th, after a night of bombardment,
the anxious envoy looked toward the fort and
there saw the flag of his country still flying proudly
over the battlements. Inspired by the sight, he wrote
the first stanza on the back of an old letter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>'O say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,</span><br>
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gave proof, through the night, that our flag was still there.</span><br>
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave,<br>
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?'</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the return to Baltimore he wrote the remaining
stanzas and the poem appeared in the Baltimore 'American'
of September 21, 1814, as a 'broadside.' The stirring
measures of the song have never lost their hold
on the American people, and the piece has taken its
place among the great national anthems of the world.</p>

<p>The next national song, in chronological order, is the
popular 'Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean' ('The Red,
White and Blue'). Its history is not so romantic.
Thomas à Becket, an English actor in 1843, playing at
that time in Philadelphia, wrote both the verses and
the music, after rejecting a set of verses written by
David T. Shaw, a singer then appearing at the 'Museum,'
also in Philadelphia. It first appeared, however,
as the work of Shaw—until à Becket convinced the publisher
of his authorship—after which it was so published,
with the inscription 'Sung by D. T. Shaw.' When
the author of the song visited England in 1847 he found
the song already 'naturalized' as 'Britannia, the Pride
of the Ocean,' and it has since become a favorite of
the British army and navy.</p>

<p>The national song répertoire received no further
notable accessions till the Civil War, a period terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
and wonderful, that called forth expressions of exalted
feeling on both sides of the struggle, North and South.
'The Star Spangled Banner' was at first claimed by
both sides. But all attempts to adapt the song by the
addition of new verses seem to have failed. The South
found an early substitute in such songs as 'Maryland,
My Maryland,' which James Ryder Randall wrote to
suit the melody of the old German folk-tune <em>O Tannenbaum</em>.
The occasion for this effusion was the attack
on the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment while marching
through Baltimore.</p>

<p>Of all the other Southern war songs only one has
survived, and that was of Northern origin. 'Dixie's
Land' was, we have already seen, originally a 'walk-around'
dance, written for Bryant's Minstrels by one of
their number, Dan Emmett. There has been so much
discussion of the circumstances of its birth that it may
be well to quote an eye-witness, so to speak, namely,
Charley White, the minstrel, whose diary has already
furnished us with some facts:</p>

<p>'One Saturday night in 1859, when Dan Emmett was
a member of Bryant's Minstrels at Mechanics' Hall,
New York, Dan [Bryant] said to Emmett: "Can't you
get us up a walk-around dance? I want something
new and lively for next Monday night." At that date,
and for a long time after, minstrel shows used to finish
up the evening performance with a walk-around dance,
in which the whole company would participate. The demand
for this especial material was constant, and Dan
Emmett was the principal composer of all, especially
for the Bryant Minstrels. Emmett, of course, went to
work, and, as he had done so much in that line of composition,
he was not long in finding something suitable.
At last he hit upon the first two bars, and any composer
can tell you how good a start that is in the manufacture
of a melody. The next day, Sunday, he had
the words commencing "I wish I was in Dixie." This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
colloquial expression is not, as most people suppose, a
Southern phrase, but first appeared among the circus
men in the North. In early fall, when nipping frost
would overtake the tented wanderers, the boys would
think of the genial warmth of the section they were
heading for and the common expression would be,
"Well, I wish I was in Dixie." This gave the title or
catch line; the rest of the song was original. On Monday
morning the song was rehearsed and highly recommended,
and at night, as usual, the house was crowded
and many of the auditors went home singing "Dixie."
The song soon became the rage and several other minstrel
organizations ... applied to Emmett for copy
and privilege of using it.... Not only was Emmett
robbed of the copyright, but the authorship of it was
disputed as well.'</p>

<p>In secession days the song was branded in the North
as a Rebel song, and a Maine editor attacked Emmett
as a Secessionist. It next bobbed up in New Orleans
in 1861 as a 'Zouave march' in 'Pocahontas,' appropriated
for the occasion by Carlo Patti, the brother of
the prima donna, who acted as conductor. When
the war broke out, the Washington Artillery had it arranged
as a quick-step and soon 'saloons, parlors, and
the streets rang with the Dixie air.' The contagious
nature of the tune easily accounts for its rapid spread
and ultimate universal popularity. It is undoubtedly
the most original of all American national songs.</p>

<p>Turning to the North, the first tune we meet is the
famous 'John Brown's Body,' one of the most stirring
marching songs ever written, a favorite among soldiers
the world over. Its origin is humble—a camp-meeting
song among many, sung by the negroes in the South
years before the War, to religious words. It may be,
indeed, a negro folk-song, though its authorship is
claimed for William Steffe, a composer of Sunday-school
music. It was started on its patriotic career<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
by the 'Tigers,' a battalion in the 12th Massachusetts
Regiment. The words 'Say, brothers, will you meet
us?' were taken from the lips of recruits by Captain
Hallgreen, the author of the poem. John Brown, the
hero of the song, was not the John Brown of Harper's
Ferry, but a good-natured Scotchman, who was the
subject of a current joke among the men. The words
were prophetic, for John Brown of the 'Tigers' lost his
life during a retreat of the Union forces. All attempts
of the superior officers to substitute a name with more
dignity and fame miscarried, and John Brown was
made immortal by his fellows. The 'Twelfth' sang the
song from city to city and the swing of it set people
wild. Later, when heard in camp, the tune appealed so
strongly to James Freeman Clarke, that he induced
Julia Ward Howe to dignify it with more serious words.
'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' was the result.</p>

<p>A composer whose Civil War songs achieved almost
the rank of national songs is George F. Root (1820-1895).
His 'Battle Cry of Freedom,' 'Tramp, Tramp,
Tramp, the Boys are Marching,' and 'Just Before the
Battle, Mother' became favorites during the war and
have enjoyed an afterglow of popularity since. Dr.
Root was an exponent of the Lowell Mason system,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and was a convention leader who had followed Mason
in his method of diffusing music among the masses. He
was a pupil of George J. Webb and also pursued the
study of his art in Paris.</p>

<p>As a final word we must recall Henry Clay Work's
'Marching through Georgia,' which is perhaps the best
of the tunes written expressly as war songs. It is a
stirring melody with all the qualities of a national anthem,
though unfortunately its partisan inspiration
and associations will not allow it to be such. There is
nothing to record in the way of patriotic songs since
the stormy days of the Civil War. Peaceful times have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>turned composers' attention elsewhere, and progress in
the higher forms of art music has gone on apace. Accordingly,
it now becomes our duty to record the
achievements of American musicians in the field of conscious
creative endeavor.</p>

<small>THE CLASSIC PERIOD OF AMERICAN COMPOSITION</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot p2b">

<p>Pioneers in American composition: Fry, Emery, Gottschalk—The Boston
group of 'classicists': Paine, Chadwick, Foote, Parker, etc.—Other
exponents of the 'classical': William Mason, Dudley Buck, Arthur Whiting,
and others—The lyricists; Ethelbert Nevin; American song writers—Composers
of church music.</p>
</div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>American musical composition lends itself to several
kinds of classification, according to the point from
which it is viewed. Historically, or, more properly
speaking, chronologically, considered, the entire output
of American composers divides itself rather naturally
into two parts. The first comprises the works of those
writers with whom this chapter deals, and who have
adopted the older models of the classic and romantic
schools. In the second group we find those writers of
a later generation who employ post-Wagner idioms.
Some of these have stopped at the Wagner boundaries,
while others, naturally the younger men, have pressed
on and are following in the steps of the ultra-modern
German or French composers. In this classification, as
in all artistic comparisons, there can be drawn no
sharp line of demarcation. We find an occasional
flash of modernity in a supposedly confirmed classicist,
while, on the other hand, among the more advanced
and iconoclastic of our modern writers we often find
a remaining trace of a severer classicism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>Outside of these two principal groups we see to-day
a constantly increasing number of composers who are
making serious attempts to weld from the several folk-song
elements of this continent a truly national music.
It was Antonin Dvořák who first counselled the American
composer to thus employ the methods from which
alone could be formed a distinctive school. Dvořák
himself, in setting the example, only proved how deep-rooted
are the traditions and feelings of the racial vein,
and placed our negro themes into a setting unmistakably
Slavic. It must be confessed that a similar result
has been obtained by most of our native composers
and the surroundings in which they have set these various
folk-song elements only serve to emphasize the decided
and almost inevitable leanings of these composers
toward one or another of the prevailing European
schools.</p>

<p>From an æsthetic standpoint our native art exhibits
the varied manifestations common to the art of all
times, traits as varied as those of human character
itself. Broadly speaking, there are always the large
and the small, which in poetic forms we can conveniently
label as epic and lyric. Of the former there is
no prodigality of output by any age or people. There
is always much of the spurious epic, and it must be
confessed that America, with its lack of national consciousness
and art discipline or tradition, together with
its over-weening ambition, has already produced its
share of this form of insincere art. On the contrary,
the number of genuine lyrical writers which America
can boast is surprisingly large, and those names which
stand out conspicuously in the annals of American art
may, almost without exception, be called lyricists.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>
</div>

<p>The first creative activities in American music were
those of the psalm-tune writers in New England, William
Billings, Oliver Holden, Lowell Mason, and others
which have been spoken of in our chapter on the Beginnings
of Musical Culture (pp. 45 ff.). Historically
these early hymns are interesting, and, had not European
culture so completely influenced the later course
of American composition, it is not unlikely that they
might have served in some measure as a contributory
vein to our native art. They remain, however, but
the reflection of the colorless puritanism which was
their source, a naïve expression which can hardly be
placed in the category of art and hence as American
compositions do not here claim our further notice.</p>

<p>While in the early years of New England there was
developing a music which, in a way, sprang from the
people—a music which really expressed a vital phase
of the common life—there were elsewhere springing
up the first growths of a more sophisticated art. This
art, borrowed from European culture, has served as the
real foundation of all that is esoteric in American
music to-day, but at the same time its presence has
fostered those influences which constitute the barrier
to a vital national expression. It is significant that
these first appearances of a more ambitious art were
in a department where there could be no nourishment
from native roots of tradition, taste, or even understanding—that
of opera.</p>

<p>In spite of these circumstances, so discouraging to
the healthy growth of a natural art-expression, it must
be related that the operas of William H. Fry (born
in Philadelphia, 1813; died 1864) were serious in their
aim and in their workmanship showed the hand of
a surprisingly skilled artist and one well versed in
the older dramatic formulas. The claim that Fry has
to the title given him by certain writers as 'the first
American composer' is therefore considerable. Fry's
training was entirely European. He was for some time
resident in Paris, where, we are told, he was a friend
of Berlioz. Of Fry's several operas 'Leonora' (produced
in 1845) seems to have been the most successful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
The book is after Victor Hugo's <em>Notre Dame de Paris</em>,
and, while the score represents merely (as do many
more modern American operatic scores) a strange
mingling echo of the several European models of the
day, there are a vitality and a grasp of form which
make the achievement in a measure phenomenal.</p>

<p>Associated with Fry in his musical life was another
pioneer of the opera field, George F. Bristow (born
in 1825; died in 1898), whose scores, however, have
less of dramatic freedom than have those of Fry, being
more strongly marked with the influences of German
classicism. Bristow's works include an opera, 'Rip Van
Winkle,' an unfinished opera, 'Columbus,' the oratorios
'Praise to God' and 'Daniel,' five symphonies, two overtures,
string quartets, and many shorter works.</p>

<p>Another name that finds place in the early annals
of American music is that of Stephen Emery (born
1841; died 1891), counted a composer in his day but
now known to us chiefly as one of America's first
theoreticians and the teacher of many whose names
are now well known.</p>

<p>Larger is the place filled by the name of Gottschalk.
Louis Moreau Gottschalk may be claimed as an American,
having been born at New Orleans in 1829, but his
decidedly Creole origin and French education seem to
remove him from the line of relationship with those
Anglo-Saxon traditions which we are apt to consider
as constituting the purely American.</p>

<p>Gottschalk enjoyed during his life equal fame as
pianist and composer. His claim to the former was
probably just; Berlioz himself spoke with enthusiasm
of his playing and of our own artists we have the
testimony of many, such as William Mason, Carl Bergmann,
and Richard Hoffman, as to the genuine enjoyment
which they obtained in hearing the concerts of
Gottschalk. But how evanescent has been the fame of
his compositions, existing only in the memory of comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
few; as entities they are already silent pages
of notes. All that is heard of his music to-day is an
occasional faint tinkle of that surviving strain of sentimentality
which was destined to such continued popularity
in the polite répertoire, 'The Last Hope.' Gottschalk
wrote two operas and several orchestral scores
and many songs, but his piano compositions comprise
the bulk of his works. While there are among these
compositions many pages of beauty not unlike that
of Chopin, and in the dance compositions on negro-creole
and Spanish themes a certain vigor and distinction,
the majority of them represent the merest vehicles
of virtuosity written to tickle the ears of a public
which had been brought up on the banalities played
by the sensational pianists that visited America in
those days. Over-sentimental, and at times vulgar, as
the art of Gottschalk now appears to us, his place in
American music is an important one and we cannot
but feel that amid environments more sustaining to
a higher ideal of art such a genuinely musical temperament
as was his would have produced an art less
ephemeral.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>These early apparitions of American musical art are
now to us only matters of history. Whatever influence
they may have had on the conditions of their day, our
present day musical life has been unaffected by them.
For the establishment of that which, for lack of better
name, we call the American school of composers we
again look to New England. Through the few composers
known as the Boston group America first assimilated
into its musical life the best traditions of European
musical culture and in the labors of these men
the American community was taught in some degree
to look seriously upon the native composer and his
achievement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span></p>

<p>First in this list is the name of the man who stands
as the patriarch of American music, John Knowles
Paine, the first professor of music at Harvard University
and the pioneer in the field of symphonic composition.
Born in Portland, Maine, in 1839, Paine received
a thorough academic training in Germany (1858-1862).
While still abroad he produced several ambitious
works and he returned to America with a fame
that eventually secured for him the chair of music
at Harvard. Here he filled an important mission in
guiding the steps of many of the younger composers
who studied with him. In the meantime Paine's academic
life by no means stifled his creative impulse
and his list of works shows a steady output up to
within a short time before his death in 1906.</p>

<p>Important among Paine's larger works are the two
symphonies, the first in C minor and the second
('Spring Symphony') in A major, the oratorio 'St.
Peter,' two symphonic poems, 'The Tempest' and 'An
Island Fantasy,' the music to Sophocles' 'Œdipus' for
male voices and orchestra, and an opera, 'Azara.' Besides
these there is a considerable list of chamber music
and much in the smaller forms.</p>

<p>Paine's music, while never approaching modernity
in the present-day application of the word, in passing
through several periods of development arrived at a
point where the idiom employed could in a broad sense
be termed modern. An anti-Wagnerite in the early
days of his academic austerity, he lived to be drawn
into the Wagner vortex and in some of his later works
the Wagner influence asserts itself. Perhaps the most
representative of Paine's works is one which belongs
to an earlier period, the music to <em>Œdipus Tyrannus</em>
(1881). In this work Paine uses a classic-romantic
medium far from rich in its color possibilities, with
which, however, he obtains a notable variety of effect
and a glowing warmth of style. In size of conception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
the summit of Paine's achievement is to be found in
his opera <em>Azara</em> (1901) composed to a libretto of his
own after the old Breton legend 'Aucassin and Nicolette.'
Containing much that is beautiful, and estimable
in its workmanship, the opera fails in dramatic force
and has never come to a stage production. A concert
performance of it was given, however, in 1906 by the
Cecilia Society of Boston under the direction of B. J.
Lang.</p>

<p>The most representative member of the present Boston
colony, as well as one of the most eminent of
American composers, is George W. Chadwick (born
1854). Mr. Chadwick's education also was a German
one and on his return to America after three years'
study in Leipzig and Munich he began to produce
works of a scholarly formality. Had the course of
Mr. Chadwick's development been arrested at this
point he might fittingly bear the title of 'academic'
which Mr. Rupert Hughes puts on him.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> But between
the date of these earlier works and Chadwick's latest
works there has been in his art a steady development
both in form and spirit, so that his recent scores,
'Adonis' (1901), 'Euterpe' (1904), 'Cleopatra' (1906), and
'Aphrodite' (1912), are distinctly representative of the
modern school. These works, while purporting to be
program music, are only qualifiedly so, for Chadwick
always preserves a certain severe formalism which
precludes the possibilities of his capitulation either to
the impressionist vagaries of modern French music or
to the polyphonic complexities of the Germans of to-day.
In spite of this tendency to formality, Mr. Chadwick
in his writing has achieved a notable freedom
of style, a dramatic force and a mastery of orchestral
color which contribute to give him a certain place
among living orchestral composers. Mr. Chadwick enjoys
the largest hearing of living American composers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></p>
<p>His name has been permanent in the lists of the Boston
Symphony, while he has had frequent hearings in
the other orchestras of America and Europe. Mr.
Chadwick is also without question the best equipped
and experienced of our native conductors, having been
for many years the director of the Springfield and
Worcester festivals.</p>

<p>Besides his orchestral works, Chadwick has shown
himself a versatile and prolific composer in a great
amount of chamber music, a large number of choral
works, a comic opera, many songs, choruses, and piano
compositions. Unlike the lyric genius of MacDowell,
his talent does not find itself so fitted to the smaller
forms and he seems often to slight them with an expression
more or less banal in its conventionality. It
must be added, however, that there are exceptions to
this and one might cite the 'Ballad of Trees and the
Master' as being one of Chadwick's best inspirations.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Foote has long been acknowledged in
Europe as one of the foremost American composers.
In his own country his influence has been as widely felt
as that of any of his countrymen. Not only by his compositions
but by his teaching as well, his name has become
pre-eminent. Graduated from Harvard in 1874,
he was granted the degree of A. M. in music the following
year. His teachers in composition were Stephen
A. Emery and Professor John Knowles Paine of Harvard.
Furthermore, he studied the piano and the organ
with B. J. Lang of Boston. All his training was received
in this country, and the results of it may well be
a source of pride to his countrymen.</p>

<p>Entering upon his career at a time when the standard
of musical performance in this country was low, he was
quick to respond to the influence of Theodore Thomas,
and later Franz Kneisel, and to exert his efforts in raising
the state of performance here toward its present
equality with that of Europe. He was no less quick to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
study and to appreciate the great works pouring out
upon Europe at that time. He has always kept in
closest touch with the development of all branches of
music down to the present, and has ever been active in
bringing new works before the public.</p>

<p>As a composer he has written in nearly all forms except
the opera. Many of his songs have achieved a
world-wide fame, such as the 'Irish Folk-song,' 'I'm
Wearing Awa' to the Land o' the Leal' and the brilliant
Bedouin song for chorus of men's voices. These songs
should not be taken as the complete expression of his
genius, but should lead to the study of his other songs,
more than a hundred in all, which are not less inspired
because more difficult. A keen insight into the possibilities
of the voice, a touch of lyric genius, and an
unfailing ingenuity in accompaniments are their distinguishing
characteristics.</p>

<p>In the treatment of string instruments Foote has been
remarkably successful. Two trios, two quartets and
a very fine piano quintet in A minor are conspicuous
in the list of American music. The quintet has been
and still is distinguished by many performances.
Through the strings he approached the orchestra. A
serenade in E for string orchestra has been frequently
heard. Two suites for full orchestra, one in D minor
and one in E, and a symphonic prologue, Francesca da
Rimini, have proved his skill in combining instruments.
Very recently he has written a series of pieces suggested
by the Rubaîyat of Omar Khayyâm, which are
far more brilliantly scored and are quite in keeping
with the modern spirit of splendid tone color.</p>

<p>As organist for many years at the First Unitarian
Church in Boston he acquired that intimate familiarity
with the possibilities of the organ which shows in the
many pieces he has written for it. But particularly as
a pianist he won a wide fame, and the more than ten
series of pianoforte pieces are written with an appreciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
of pianistic effect which distinguishes them in
the main from nearly all other pianoforte music produced
in this country. Nor should the skill he has
shown in editing the pianoforte works of many of the
great masters pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>Of his compositions as a whole it may be said that
they are astonishingly original in an age which has
found it all but impossible to escape imitation. He is,
like most of the great composers, largely self-taught,
and yet there is scarcely a trace of mannerisms; nor
what is even more remarkable, of the mannerisms of
others. His music is the pure and perfectly formed expression
of a nature at once refined and imaginative.
In these days of startling innovations, the sincerity of
which may not be unhesitatingly trusted, it sounds none
the less spirited because it is unquestionably genuine
and relatively simple. It stands forth as a substantial
proof that delicate poetry and clear-cut workmanship
have not yet failed to charm.</p>

<p>Although he has lived at New Haven for the past
twenty years, during which time he has been professor
of music at Yale, Horatio Parker's career is in a large
measure identified with Boston and its circles. Parker
was born (1863) at Auburndale, a suburb of Boston,
and his earliest teachers were Stephen Emery and
Chadwick. After his preliminary studies with these
men Parker studied with Rheinberger in Munich. Returning
home in 1885, he soon began to attract notice
by the excellence of his compositions and to-day
he stands as one of the commanding figures in American
music. His compositions have won a dignified
place for themselves and his conscientious labors at
Yale have created a music department that far excels
those of the other American universities in the practical
advantages which it offers to the serious music
student.</p>

<p>The list of Parker's works is long and varied. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
contains, besides his two most famous works (the oratorio
<em>Hora Novissima</em> and the opera 'Mona'), several
orchestral scores, among others an overture (in E flat),
a symphony, and 'A Northern Ballad.' There are also
several shorter choral works, a few chamber music
works, including a string quartet, a string quintet, and
a suite for piano, violin and 'cello, besides many songs
and piano pieces.</p>

<p>The same qualities of Parker's art which contribute
to the success of <em>Hora Novissima</em>, the first work to
bring him fame, are those which operate against the
success of his latest and largest effort, the opera
'Mona.' The former offered to the composer the most
suitable field for his scholarly but somewhat ascetic
conceptions and by this same self-contained and poised
loftiness of style, together with a rare skill in handling
vocal masses in contrapuntal design, does he achieve in
<em>Hora Novissima</em> a work of genuine strength and a valuable
addition to the list of modern oratorios. The
work, written in 1893 for the Church Choral Society
of New York, received its first performance by that
body. Performances by several other choral societies
and at several musical festivals in America rapidly followed,
and in 1899 it had the honor of being the first
American work to appear upon the program of the
Three Choirs Festival in Worcester, England, at which
performance the composer conducted. Since that time
it has assumed its place among the standard choral
works of our day.</p>

<p>Parker's opera, 'Mona,' was awarded the prize offered
by the Metropolitan Opera Company in 1911 in a
contest of American composers. Its score reveals an
enormous advance in the composer's mastery of resource,
both as regards dramatic expression and orchestral
color. There are an admirable freedom of line
and sustained polyphonic interest, while the skill with
which the orchestral color is distributed exhibits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
Parker's strongest feature. In spite of these merits the
almost unanimous opinion of the music critics must
be admitted, in a degree, as just. The opera, upon its
production at the Metropolitan Opera House, New
York, in 1911-12, was found to be lacking in a really
convincing musical grip, due to the absence of an
underlying emotional warmth and to the essentially
unmelodic treatment of the solo voices. The choruses
and mass effects proved the best features of the opera,
again showing that Mr. Parker's first successes were in
a field more suited to his talents than the domain of
dramatic music. Another opera, 'Fairyland,' won another
prize of ten thousand dollars in 1915.</p>

<p>Mrs. H. H. A. Beach stands quite in a class by herself
as the only American woman who has essayed
compositions in the larger form. Her success entitles
her to a prominent place among the most serious of
American composers. Her 'Gaelic Symphony' and her
sonata for violin and piano are two long successful
works, while recently she has had a most cordial and
flattering reception in Europe for her piano concerto
in which she herself played the solo part. Besides
these works Mrs. Beach has written a <em>Jubilate</em> for
chorus with orchestra, and a quantity of piano music
and songs, of which some of the latter have achieved
a wide popularity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beach at her best writes in a broad and bold
vein with a pulsing rhythmical sense, a natural melodic
line, and she exhibits an extraordinary strength in the
sustained and impassioned quality of her climaxes. On
the other side, Mrs. Beach may be accused of having
a harmonic sense rather too persistently conventional
and in her less inspired moments her fault is that
which Mr. Hughes<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> has pointed out, namely, a tendency
to over-elaboration.</p>

<p>There are several other composers whose labors are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>identified with the musical life of Boston, although in
some instances they have not been continuously resident
there. Louis Adolphe Coerne received his early
training at Harvard under Prof. Paine and was later
awarded a doctor's degree in philosophy by the same
university for his excellent book 'The Development of
the Modern Orchestra.' Coerne's achievement in composition
has been considerable; he is the author of two
operas, one of which has been successfully performed
in Germany. Other works include a symphonic poem
on 'Hiawatha' and a ballet, 'Evadne.'</p>

<p>James C. D. Parker is one of the names associated
with the older days of Boston's musical growth, for
Mr. Parker graduated from Harvard in 1848 and his
'Redemption Hymn' was performed by the Handel and
Haydn Society in 1877. He is best known by several
melodious songs and by his church music.</p>

<p>George Whiting and George W. Marston are names
which perhaps belong more properly in the list of
church composers, as they were both closely identified
with that field. The former, however, has written several
works of large dimension, notably a cantata, 'The
Golden Legend,' which has been much praised, while
Mr. Marston's name is known outside of church circles
by a surprisingly long list of songs, which, though
slight in construction, are not without imaginative
qualities.</p>

<p>Although not attaining to such a mastery of the
more amplified forms as does Mrs. Beach, Margaret
Ruthven Lang has made several successful essays in
the form of orchestral overtures, which have been
played. Miss Lang's best-known works, however, are
her songs, the widespread popularity of certain ones
of which has given her a real and lasting fame as a
song writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In grouping the foregoing names and labelling them
as the 'Boston group' it must not be understood to imply
that the art of these writers forms a school in the
sense of its having a common distinctive idiom or style.
The group marks in some of its members, as has been
said before, an early era of American composition.
The fact that Boston became the birthplace of America's
first serious musical art was probably due to the
presence there of the largest and best permanent orchestra,
to the establishment of the first university department
of music (at Harvard), and doubtless also in
no small degree to the general intellectual life of the
New England metropolis.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, however, locality plays but a
small part in marking the traits of our native composers.
As in all places and at all times, opportunity
to hear and to be heard has drawn the best talent to
the larger centres. The musical life of New York,
as well as that of Chicago, while differing in many essential
features from that of Boston, discloses many
similar phases of artistic endeavor as we compare the
contemporaneous musical life of these cities.</p>

<p>Among the names of those who were the pioneers
in the musical culture of New York none is better
known than that of William Mason, the first of America's
great pianists, who in his earlier life did valiant
service in America for the cause of Schumann and
Brahms and whose entire life represents one of the
highest and most effective of America's cultural influences.
Dr. Mason was a son of Lowell Mason (q. v.)
and was born in 1829. He spent the years from
1849 to 1854 in Europe, where he was one of the intimate
circle of pupils which surrounded Liszt at Weimar.</p>

<p>Dr. Mason's place as a composer is not a large one.
His list of works is represented almost exclusively
by piano compositions, of which he wrote about forty.
They are all in the smaller mold, and, while they are
rather stereotyped and conventional in their lines, they
have found a place in the pianistic répertoire as grateful
and pleasing pieces of piano music.</p>

<p>The composer of church music has had a large place
in the field of American composition. The impetus
given to this branch of art by the New England 'psalm-tune
teachers' was a strong one and it is but a natural
consequence of their labors that to-day the church
commands the services of so many of our writers. We
shall consider the church composers and their works
in subsequent paragraphs of this chapter, but the name
of the Nestor of anthem writers—Dudley Buck—deserves
mention in this place as being one of the first
workers in the general musical service of earlier days
in New York. Moreover, while the present fame of
Buck rests largely upon his church music and upon
one or two deservedly popular songs, he must not be
overlooked as one of the first composers in America
to essay the larger forms of cantata and oratorio.</p>

<p>Buck was born in Hartford in 1839. He studied at
Paris and at Dresden for two years. Returning to
America, he pursued his career first in his native city,
later at Chicago and Boston, finally settling in 1875 at
New York, where he passed the remainder of his life.
Apart from the large mass of church music, more
largely representative of his real mission than any
other of his compositions, the list of Buck's works includes
a symphonic overture 'Marion,' a comic opera
'Deseret,' besides a list of something like eighteen cantatas,
the most ambitious of which is 'The Light of
Asia.'</p>

<p>Buck's style never achieved a distinctive vein, nor is
it ever marked with a loftiness of conception, but instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
there are, in the best of his pages, a Mendelssohnian
fluency of writing and a natural melodic line which
have gained for his works the favor of a large public.</p>

<p>One of the first native composers to receive serious
recognition in Chicago was Silas G. Pratt, a musician
who seems to have had a Wagner-like genius for self-exploitation,
but whose brilliant career must be said
to have been incommensurate with the real value of
his works. Pratt was born in 1846 and as early as
1872 gave a concert of his own works in Chicago. Several
years later he produced some of his larger works
at concerts in Germany and England, and in 1885 his
oratorio, 'The Prodigal Son,' and an anniversary overture
were given in London. His opera 'Zenobia' had
meanwhile (1882) been given in Chicago. Besides
these works Pratt wrote two symphonies, a symphonic
suite, and several works which are evidently an effort
toward a national music, at least such is the implication
of their titles and programs. One of these represents
a battle of the Civil War, another depicts the incidents
of Paul Revere's ride, while a third bears the
impressive title 'The Battle of Manila.'</p>

<p>Another potent activity in the earlier days of Chicago's
musical life was that of Frederic Grant Gleason
(born in 1848), who has to his credit an imposing list
of large works, including two operas, 'Montezuma' and
<em>Otho Visconte</em>, a symphonic poem, 'Edris,' several cantatas,
and many smaller works. Gleason was highly
esteemed by Theodore Thomas, who produced many
of his works in the Chicago concerts of the Thomas
Orchestra.</p>

<p>Henry Schoenefeld was one of the first Americans
to follow Dvořák's suggestion in adopting native folk-song
as thematic material. Schoenefeld was born in
Milwaukee in 1857 and on his return from Europe in
1879 took up his residence in Chicago. Not unlike his
are the talents and aims of Maurice Arnold, another of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
the first to exploit the negro themes, which he successfully
incorporated into a violin sonata and a series of
'Plantation Dances.' Both will receive more extended
notice in a later chapter.</p>

<p>As against these early efforts at instilling negro
flavor into our national music may be noted one of
the first attempts at utilizing Indian music as a thematic
basis. This was done by Frederick R. Burton
in his cantata 'Hiawatha' (1898). Besides this, the most
successful of his works, Burton wrote a cantata, 'The
Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' and the last years of his life
were devoted to writing one of the most important
contributions to the literature of American folk-music,
a book on Indian music entitled 'American Primitive
Music,' which was published in 1909, after Mr. Burton's
death.</p>

<p>New York is often accused of being peculiarly non-representative
of typical American life. The accusation
is, in a measure, just and holds good in its application
to musical conditions. As the metropolis, where,
without doubt, more music than anywhere else in the
country is heard, New York lacks a local life of its
own; there is no feeling of neighborly companionship
among its art workers, and in consequence there
hardly exists that which we could term a New York
'group' of composers in the sense to which the term is
applied to Boston's community of music-makers. New
York claims as citizens many of America's best known
composers, but they figure too little in the musical
life of the city and are the objects of too little local
pride.</p>

<p>An exception to this, however, is found in the case
of Arthur Whiting, whose concerts bring him often
into public view and whose local reputation as a pianist
is undoubtedly far greater than his recognition as a
composer. Deserving of the latter, however—and that
by reason of a very serious and notable achievement in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
creative fields—Arthur Whiting must be counted as
one of the real ornaments of America's list of composers.
Mr. Whiting's well-known Brahms enthusiasm
and his activities as a producer of Brahms' works
bring upon him the suspicion of being a thorough-going
Brahmsite, even in his own compositions; a suspicion,
however, not well founded, for Mr. Whiting is quite
free from the Brahms influence. That he is ofttimes
prone to intellectuality, and too rarely gives himself
up to the spontaneous and expressively beautiful, is
perhaps a more just accusation, but the statement that
Mr. Whiting is an artist of deep sincerity, of high
ideals, and of thorough equipment must remain unchallenged.</p>

<p>Mr. Whiting's recent work has been almost exclusively
in the smaller forms. He has, however, in the
past written several larger works, the best known of
which is his Fantasie for piano and orchestra. This
work, recently revived at a concert given by the American
Academy, has a rhythmic energy that makes it
'American' in the best sense—a genuine and spontaneous
expression of the national nervously intense
temperament. For the most part, however, the orchestra
has seemed to have but small inspiration to offer to
him and his sober formal sense and his own distinctions
of style lead him more naturally to the piano, the
vocal quartet, and to other chamber music combinations
as his medium of expression.</p>

<p>Henry Holden Huss is principally known through
his successful handling of the larger forms and he can
point with just pride to the real success which has
been that of his piano concerto in D minor, his violin
concerto, and his sonata for violin and piano. These,
as well as a sonata for violoncello and piano, have all
found acceptance with a number of the best living
interpretive musicians, who have given Huss a very
wide hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Huss acknowledges himself a thorough-going
Wagnerite and confesses to coming largely under the
influence of his works, but the bulk of his writings
shows other influences, notably in the strong sense of
the classic cyclical form, which Mr. Huss handles with
an excellent mastery and in which he proves himself
an artist of great resource and equipment. Another
favorite form with Huss is the extended aria with orchestra,
and in this form he has written several of his
best works. Among these may be mentioned 'Cleopatra's
Death' for soprano, 'Nocturne' for the same
voice, 'The Seven Ages of Man' for baritone, 'Home
They Brought Her Warrior Dead' for alto, and 'After
Sorrow's Night' for soprano. In the last-named work
Mr. Huss has employed a harmonic scheme which in
its modern freedom represents his most advanced development.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>At the head of the list of America's lyricists there
stands a name perhaps more illustrious than any other
which she boasts—that of Ethelbert Nevin. To speak
critically of the art of Nevin is a delicate and a difficult
task. Its nature does not invite critical examination
or demand extended analysis. Nevin's music, in
its absence of decided intellectual qualities, presents
no striking originalities of style, but remains throughout
the simply spontaneous and unaffected utterance
of a real and deeply musical nature. It possesses,
nevertheless, a strongly individual style (often becoming,
we must confess, a mannerism) and an irresistible
charm. Moreover, the wide appeal which it has made
must be sufficient proof of the real vitality that underlies
the seemingly slight psysiognomy of this delicate
lyricism. To the aspiring mind, in the presence of
an expression so genuine, there must come a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
regret that with such poetical tenderness and grace
there should not have been a vein of greater virility
to have sounded a deeper note; one that would have
played a more important part in the upbuilding of our
national art. Despite the fact that the natural flow
of Nevin's lyricism beguiled him continually along the
lines of least resistance, his life's record was that of
a very hard-working and conscientious artist.</p>

<p>Nevin was born near Pittsburgh in 1862. He had
the advantage of early musical studies at home and
abroad during a European sojourn of his family and
he commenced his professional studies in 1881 under
B. J. Lang and Stephen Emery in Boston. In 1884 he
went to Berlin, where he worked diligently at his piano
studies under Karl Klindworth. Returning home, two
years later, he settled at Boston and taught, concertized,
and followed more zealously his increasing inclination
for composition. In 1891, after the publication of some
of the songs and piano pieces which have since become
so generally popular, Nevin's fame rapidly increased
and he was able to indulge his taste for the roving life
which he followed during the last ten years of his
life, living at Paris, Berlin, Florence, Algiers, and elsewhere,
with intervening visits to America, where he
was heard in concerts of his own works. In the fall
of 1900 Nevin settled at New Haven, where he died
suddenly in February, 1901.</p>

<p>The list of Nevin's works comprises almost exclusively
short songs and piano compositions. Exceptions
to this are several choruses, two pieces for violin and
piano, and a posthumously published cantata. That
Nevin had larger ambitions in his later life is shown
from certain of his letters and the sketches of larger
works which he left unfinished. But as the result of
his early habits of composition, of the too easy flow
of his melody, and perhaps also of his too early successes
he was kept within the confines of those miniature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
and delicate forms which he made his own domain.
The characteristics of Nevin's music, as displayed
in these works, are, first, a melodic sense which,
though lacking in variety because of decided mannerisms
that control it, is full of graceful charm and genuine
lyrical quality; second, a harmonic sense ever
more limited in its scope but of natural and moving
expressiveness. Into the naïve fabric of this the composer
contrived to instil a flavor which, if not decidedly
original, had a strongly individual feeling.</p>

<p>The first of Nevin's works to reach any popularity
was 'A Sketch Book,' published in 1888. Several of
its numbers are still reckoned among the most popular
of Nevin's works. This was followed by several similar
albums of songs and piano pieces until 1891, when, in
a book of piano pieces entitled 'Water Scenes,' he published
what was to be a piece of world-wide popularity,
'Narcissus.' 'A Book of Songs' (1893) contains the
best of Nevin's vocal works. Regarded as a whole, they
lack a uniformity of style and despite Mr. Thompson's
assertion<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> that Nevin felt but slightly the influences
of other composers, these songs show decided traces
of the stamp which the study of other writers put
upon his work. Chopin is perhaps the prevailing influence
that shows itself. Some of the songs of this
group mark Nevin's nearest approach to a dramatic
style. In parts of number seven of this group, entitled
Nocturne, there is a considerable sweep of fiery
strength, and the two entitled 'Orsola's Song' and 'In
the Night' exhibit a virile content rarely present in
Nevin's work. We need not speak of the more popular
songs of Nevin, such as 'The Rosary,' 'Little Boy Blue,'
''Twas April,' and 'Mighty Lak' a Rose.' Their appeal
lies largely in the sentimental though genuinely tender
and deep touch of pathos which they contain.</p>

<p>Nevin's piano works are distinctly Chopinesque.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>
<p>Suave and elegant figures, grateful to the player,
abound in these works and show the hand of the skillful
pianist that Nevin was. Some of these piano pieces
have become quite as popular as have the songs, and
the collections entitled 'In Arcady' and 'A Day in Venice'
have been placed in the household répertoire.</p>

<p>Ethelbert Nevin made no claims for his art. Almost
unconscious of the larger world of a more universal
expression, which the past and present might have
offered to him, he created his own limited world and
lived therein. We shall mistake, however, if we judge
too slightingly of this world as the dilettante expression
of a mere <em>précieux</em>. Something there is of genius in
a man who can speak to so many. Ethelbert Nevin
was an ornament to American music and the fame of
his works will outlive the bulk of our more esoteric
art.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It is difficult to find a fitting name to follow that of
Nevin. While we have had writers in the smaller
forms who equalled and even surpassed Nevin in dramatic
force, or in subtleties of construction, the remainder
of our purely lyrical writers, it must be said, are
on a considerably lower plane and there is lacking
in the work of most of them the elegance and fastidiousness
which bring these small works within the pale
of art. The status of many American songs is—unfortunately
with truth—described in Grove's Dictionary
(Vol. IV, 'Song'), where it is said: 'Many other American
composers whose songs, whilst enjoying a great
popularity, descend almost to the lowest level of vocal
music.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>
</div>

<p>There are, however, a good many men whose works
are saved from this condemnation. Notable among
these is Wilson G. Smith (born in 1855), whose songs
and piano contributions, while they must perhaps be
designated as salon pieces, possess, nevertheless, a
genuine charm. Many of Smith's piano pieces are an
intentional imitation of other composers, in which field
he is particularly happy. Of his songs there are a
number which have been much sung. Rupert Hughes,
with a just critical sense, not always his, points out the
excellence of Smith's song 'If I but Knew,' as especially
notable.</p>

<p>Certain of Reginald de Koven's songs rival in popularity
the light operas of that composer (see Chap.
XV). After many years of use 'O Promise Me' still
retains its place in the popular affections, as was
demonstrated in the repeated encores demanded for
it when it was interpolated in a recent revival of 'Robin
Hood.' De Koven's lyricism, however, is of the lightest
order and his failure to strike a deeper vein is well
attested in the empty pomposity of his setting of Kipling's
'Recessional.'</p>

<p>A composer to whose songs Henry T. Finck in his
'Songs and Song Writers' gives a special place is Clayton
Johns, of Boston (born 1857), who was a pupil of
Paine and later studied two years at Berlin. Johns'
songs number about one hundred. Mr. Finck finds in
them a Franz-like quality and attributes their popularity
to a simplicity without emptiness. Besides songs,
Mr. Johns has written a few choruses and two pieces
for string orchestra.</p>

<p>Frederick Field Bullard is another composer who
wisely realized the natural limitations of his muse and
devoted himself almost exclusively to song writing.
His most successful song was his stirring and widely
popular 'Stein Song,' which by its frequent use on all
sorts of occasions has attached to itself somewhat the
importance of a national song. Bullard's larger ambitions
found expression in the ballad form, which he
chose for a setting of Tennyson's melodrama 'The
Sisters.'</p>

<p>W. H. Neidlinger (born in 1863) was a pupil of Dudley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
Buck. His long list of compositions comprises almost
exclusively songs. The instinctive naïveté of Mr.
Neidlinger's style has contributed to his success in a
number of children's songs.</p>

<p>Of a larger mold and a more intensive beauty is the
lyricism of Marcus Carroll, a composer Irish born but
whose entire musical life has been spent in, and belongs
to, America. Mr. Carroll's works include several
short pieces for orchestra. There is an 'Intermezzo' of
melodic and colorful beauty which was played by
Anton Seidl, while a 'Dance of the Gnomes' and a
'Valse' have been often heard at the 'pop' concerts in
Boston. Besides these there is a 'Romance' for 'cello
and orchestra and some part-songs of which the charming
cycle of songs for women's voices from Stevenson's
'Child's Garden of Verses,' entitled 'A Child's Day,' have
been much sung. Mr. Carroll shows himself in these
works to be a most gifted melodist. His style is sincere,
straightforward, at times conventional, but there are a
warmth of feeling and an abundance of color, grace,
and vitality which render his work notably successful.</p>

<p>Another foreign-born composer who must be counted
in the list of Americans is Edward Manning. Mr. Manning
was born in Canada, but came early in life to New
York where he studied with MacDowell. The greater
part of Mr. Manning's compositions are songs, although
there has lately come from his pen a trio for strings
and piano which must take rank with the very best
of American chamber music. Another larger work of
Manning's is an aria, 'The Tryst,' for soprano and orchestra,
which has been sung by Louise Homer. Manning
has the essential and rare equipment of the real
composer, the melodic gift. There is a strong Grieg
flavor in his melodies and often in his harmonic treatment
of them, but later songs show a tendency to a
more advanced modernity.</p>

<p>Frank LaForge follows narrowly the path of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
German <em>lied</em> composers. With no decided originalities,
Mr. LaForge has written many highly artistic songs
which often find place in song recital programs, especially
in those of Mme. Gadski.</p>

<p>The name of Charles B. Hawley is one that for many
years has figured largely on American singers' programs.
Mr. Hawley has a true melodic vein which runs
freely through a large number of songs. His harmonic
treatment is, on the other hand, of the most conventional
and there is nothing in his works to court
criticism of an intimate order. Mr. Hawley in these
characteristics stands as typical of quite a large group
of American song writers. These composers write
fluently, melodically, gracefully, and occasionally attain
to a commanding lyrical eloquence, but for the greater
part their work lacks distinction and flavor. Always
too conventional, sometimes to a point of banality, it
cannot contribute much to the upbuilding of a serious
art in this country. The group thus described contains
such writers as Victor Harris, C. W. Coombs, R. Huntington
Woodman, Charles Gilbert Spross, James H.
Rogers, Bruno Huhn, James W. Metcalfe, Ward
Stephens, William G. Hammond, Franklin Riker, Oley
Speaks, Jessie Gaynor, and Edna R. Parks.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>America's contribution to church music has been
large and varied. As chamber music seems to serve as
the practice field for German composers, so does church
music apparently occupy the less aspiring or intense
moments of most of our writers. Composers of all
classes and leanings have offered their share to the
constantly increasing list of anthems and services to
be found in the catalogues of our publishers and there
seems to be, moreover, a legion whose entire efforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
are in this field. As a whole this music may be classified
like the music of other departments: a comparatively
small percentage of it is good, much is mediocre,
while the vast balance is worthless. The meritorious
section of this work subdivides itself into several kinds
of excellence. We have among our church musicians
a certain few who write the sober and so-called ecclesiastical
style which the canons of the English schools
have laid down as being the fitting adjunct of the
church's service, while, again, particularly in America,
a large amount of church music is couched in an idiom
somewhat more secular in tone, in which a more popular
melodic treatment lends so-called 'human interest'
to the work. To the more ascetic this form of
writing is the bane of church music. Gounod is perhaps
the instigator of this practice of importing into
the church the profane sensuousness of a more worldly
art. Despite a strong note of reactionary protest, he
has had many imitators both in England and America,
and the 'operatic' anthem has become a standard form.
Of these two classes of church music, namely, the essentially
sacred and that more secularly tinged, it is
the latter that is abused in American church music.
Whereas in England the great respect for tradition
keeps most of her church composers within the narrow
paths of ecclesiastical austerity—where, it must be
said, they often become contrapuntally arid or musty—the
American anthem writer too often sins on the other
side and has a strong tendency to become sentimentally
maudlin in accepting as a working rule Voltaire's keen
definition of church music as 'the pursuit of sensuous
pleasure in the duties of a cult established to combat
such a pursuit.'</p>

<p>Many of the composers whose works have been the
subject of the foregoing pages have written for the
church, and in some cases their church music represents
an important phase of their work. We have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
already spoken of Mr. Buck's importance as a church
composer; other earlier composers whose church music
was important are G. W. Marston, who wrote many anthems
and sacred songs; W. W. Gilchrist, whose list
of anthems and church cantatas is a long one; C. C.
Converse, who, besides essaying a vast deal of serious
music in a larger way, found his best success in several
well-known hymns. Richard Henry Warren, Remington
R. Fairlamb, and Smith N. Penfield are also names
that have figured in the recent decades of ecclesiastical
composition.</p>

<p>Horatio Parker, whose works we have already reviewed,
is at present the most representative church
composer in America. Parker has devoted some of
his best inspirations to the church and has written
many fine anthems and services, while his stirring
hymn-tunes, with their modern harmonies, mark a real
stage of evolution in that restricted field. Foote and
Chadwick have both done much in church music;
there is, however, a neutral quality about their anthems
and they possess neither the distinctive qualities of the
purely ecclesiastical style nor that of the popular anthem.
Arthur Whiting has written comparatively little
church music but the few things that he has done are
among the best of all American church music. There
is a feeling of great strength and solidity in Mr. Whiting's
vocal writing and his style is always pure. The
other church composers who generally follow the more
severe style are mostly members of America's English
colony of organists, true to the tradition of their training:
Will C. Macfarlane, Clement R. Gale, T. Tertius
Noble, are to be named as some of the best known
of these writers.</p>

<p>It is most fortunate that the more popular style of
anthem has one exponent who brings to it not only
its essential elements of popularity, but who is able to
add as well those sterling qualities of intrinsic musical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
worth which place his anthems in a unique class. This
writer is Harry Rowe Shelley. Shelley was born in
1858. His first studies were under Dudley Buck and
he later studied with Dvořák in Europe. His list of
about fifty anthems are deservedly the most popular
of native works used in American churches to-day,
and his sacred songs are also a most serviceable addition
to the church répertoire. It must be added that,
although Mr. Shelley has found his truest mission in
church music, he has had larger ambitions which he
has not entirely failed in fulfilling, and the list of his
works includes an opera, 'Leila,' a symphonic poem,
'The Crusaders,' a dramatic overture, <em>Francesca da
Rimini</em>, an oratorio, 'The Inheritance Divine,' a suite
for orchestra, a fantasia for piano and orchestra, piano
pieces and songs.</p>

<p>Among those whose work follows lines similar to
that of Shelley is P. J. Schnecker, whose numerous
anthems possess somewhat the physiognomy of Shelley's
works, but are without their genuine musical
qualities. John Hyatt Brewer has written church music
of considerable distinction as well as several cantatas
both sacred and secular. Brewer was a pupil of Buck
and was born in 1856. Sumner Salter, Gerrit Smith,
Louis R. Dressler, Frank N. Shepherd, Fred Schelling,
are other names familiar to the choir loft. Important
among church compositions are the works of Eduardo
Marzo. Mr. Marzo's work is mostly for the Catholic
service and, thus restricted in its use, it has not come
to the general notice which it would otherwise have
reached.</p>

<p>In concluding, we add a few names of those who,
among the younger men, are producing church music
of a freshness and vigor which promises well for a
renaissance of sacred music that shall happily combine
the dignity of the older schools with the more
vital utterance of a contemporaneous expression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
Frank E. Ward, whose secular compositions find mention
in another chapter of this volume, has written
many good anthems and two sacred cantatas. Philip
James is the author of some strikingly good church
music, while Mark Andrews, Clifford Demarest, Caryl
Florio, and W. Berwald are well-known and esteemed
names to those who follow the lists of standard church
music.</p>

<p>Between the founders of musical composition in
America, who felt chiefly the influence of that musical
world of which Beethoven was the great central figure,
and those who have looked to aboriginal and other
native sources for inspiration on the one hand, or European
ultra-modern tendencies on the other, there exists
a large and important group of American composers
whose artistic origin is to be associated with
the so-called 'romantic' school, of which Schumann is
the generally accepted protagonist. Proudly as the
dramatic phase of the romantic movement shone forth
at the same time in the genius of Richard Wagner, it
was left with the non-dramatic wing of the romantic
school to establish the ideals which should dominate
and direct the romantic movement which was subsequently
to arise in America. There are a number of
reasons why this should have been the case, as there
are also reasons to believe that the full influence of
Wagner's ideas has not yet been felt in America.
In the first place, it was during the epoch of the romantic
movement that the German musician and music
teacher first began to look to the new world as a field
for the broad extension of his labors. Every city and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
town of America came to have its German music teachers;
they were accepted everywhere as representatives
of the highest musical civilization of the
world, and it is, in fact, to this early German
musical emigration that the substantial foundations of
our American musical education are due. As qualifying
factors, however, in the influence which he was
to exert upon the future, there were two facts in general
which characterized him: his profession, which
was usually that of pianist and piano teacher, and his
anathematization of Wagner. While Beethoven was
his musical god, in his capacity of pianist he also spread
the influence of that side of the romantic movement
which perpetuated, and developed, the tradition of
piano music. Thus Schumann and Chopin, and their
contemporaries, came to a measurable fullness of appreciation
in America at a time when Wagner was
held to be a mad and dangerous musical anarchist.</p>

<p>Quite aside from this group of circumstances, it was
also true that nothing could be more remote from the
American civilization of the time than the possibility
of any semblance of the realization of Wagner's ideals.
Opera was the most fitful and exotic of institutions,
and the theatre in general, except for such occasional
meteoric apparitions as Edwin Booth, was in a condition
of the greatest crudity, as well as being under
the ban of a puritanism which, fortunately, in these
latter days, is beginning somewhat to relax its tenacity.
Because of the unripeness of American life for a creative
art of music, the influence of the early German
invasion did not produce many composers. It had,
however, implanted ideals which were to assume the
greatest importance in the future. When the overwhelming
Wagnerian flood at last arrived, in the splendid
productions of the music-dramas under the direction
of Seidl and the Damrosches, it found the ideals
of the classical and romantic schools already well implanted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
more than that, it found a rapidly increasing
group of young composers who had arisen under the
influence of those ideals. The result was that these
composers, who did not share the prejudices of their
Teutonic musical forbears, drank in with avidity the
wonderful new harmonies of Wagner, and set about
incorporating them, not in music-dramas, but in the
sonatas and symphonies arising from the classical tradition,
and all manner of free forms to which the romantic
school had given birth. The Wagnerian harmonies
were accepted, but the forms of the earlier
movements were retained, except where the followers
of Liszt ventured forth on scantily charted seas of formal
emancipation. Similarly other new influences began
to be felt, and Tschaikowsky, in a new symphonic
emotionalism, and Brahms, in a new flowering of thematic
development, gave encouragement in the retaining
of earlier forms. The dual product of these various
influences was, on the one hand, a romanticism which
claimed both harmonic and formal freedom, and a neo-classicism
which welcomed the new harmonic world
opened up by Wagner, but inclined to cling to the
forms of the classical epoch.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>As the first modern American composer to step forth
with a highly characterized poetic individuality, Edward
Alexander MacDowell (b. 1861, d. 1908) quickly
took, and his work has held, since his untimely death
in 1908, a unique and preëminent place in American
music. As the first great pioneer of the romantic school
in America his place is certainly assured, and, while
the perspective thus far gained upon his work has by
no means led to a unanimity of opinion concerning it,
the dignity, charm, and poetic fancy of a great part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
of it must assuredly give it an enduring position in
the musical world. All barriers of adverse criticism
and opinion fall before creativeness, to the extent to
which it is truly creative, and it is the creative character
of MacDowell's music that insures its persistence.
Noteworthy is it also that it is through his greatest
works, such as the second piano concerto and the Celtic
Sonata, that his fame chiefly endures, a convincing
evidence that his highest aspirations did not strike wide
of their mark.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the nature of MacDowell's genius
must perforce lead us to a recognition of his Celtic
antecedents and sympathies; for with all his early
German experience and training, with all his substantial
Teutonic technical foundation gained thereby,
he was first and last a Celt in spirit. Over the heavy
bog of German harmony and counterpoint his sensitive
fancy danced like restless thistledown, following the
lightest whimsey of the breeze and the most tremulous
maneuverings of shadow-play. In his more
powerful tone painting it is the elements, rather than
the passions, that command him. The old nature-worship
which is so ineradicable an element of the
psychic constitution of the Celt, and which leads him
to commune with the innumerable and elusive hosts of
the land of faery, never forsook the soul of MacDowell,
or ceased to direct the course of his genius. Impatient
of the restraints of the outer world, and of its weight
of poetry-quenching affairs and transactions, his spirit
hurried ever to a communion with the moods and mysteries
of nature, and to that corresponding dream-world
of intensified nature-perceptions within the soul
to which these are the appointed and the alluring
gateway. MacDowell's dream-world was directly conjoined
with that of 'Fiona Macleod,' whose subjective
nature-pictures offer a close literary parallel to the
tone-pictures of the composer. These two traversed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
the same region, which is that of the psychic perceptions,
but the account of it brought back by MacDowell
presents one striking fundamental difference from all
accounts rendered by poetry-making Celts who have
remained upon their native soil. In the American the
soul no longer cries out from under an age-long burden
of poverty and oppression; the heartache and the
world-weariness have been sloughed off in the new-world
birth. No outcry of the heart is the music of
MacDowell, but an eager self-surrendering to the interpretation
of the facts and moods of nature, the
rocking of a lily-pad on cool waters, the lonely drift
of an iridescent iceberg, the mad sudden impact of
a hurrying gust. Often are these interpretations of an
almost uncanny intimacy, so subtle and sensitive is
their touch.</p>

<p>In one very important respect the personal analogy
between MacDowell and William Sharp breaks down.
The creator of 'Fiona Macleod' gained the freedom of
the psychic world only at the expense of his virility.
The <em>man</em>, Sharp, was left behind, when 'Fiona's' turn
came, a fact attested by the writings of the latter at
every point. MacDowell found no need for the splitting
up of his personality into its masculine and feminine
elements; he carried his manhood with him into
the sphere of the psychic and brought forth not artistic
shadowings merely, but also, especially in his heroic
moments, solid structures. For all his instinctive abhorrence
of the ponderousness often associated with
the expression of the Teutonic spirit, his severe Frankfort
training often served him in good stead; it may,
indeed, have been the balance-wheel of his entire artistic
life.</p>

<p>Too much the child of nature's dream-world to
sound the depths of passion, too restless with the joy
of nature's kaleidoscopic shift and play to touch the
spiritual heights of peace, well severed from the material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
world, but not yet united with the spiritual, MacDowell
hovered in the mid-region of the psychic, happily
lost in its shadowy wonderworld of dissolving
forms and elusive beauty. This was at once the limitation
and tragedy, as well as the genius, of MacDowell's
life and art. He remained a wanderer on the borderlands
of spirit, never coming to his spiritual home,
and at the end his mind itself wandered never to return
in this life. But he had struck a telling blow for
American musical art, and placed the nation upon a
new musical footing.</p>

<p>MacDowell was a nationalist only by virtue of his
instinctive sensitiveness to his environment. As the
English critic, Ashton-Johnson, has pointed out, his
autumn scenes spontaneously portray not the mere
brown decay of the European "fall," but the golden
splendor of the American autumn. The Indian and
the negro find their way into his works here and there
in delicate touches, because the tradition of them is
in the American air and scarcely to be avoided.</p>

<p>MacDowell's teachers in theory were Savard, at the
Paris Conservatoire, and Joachim Raff, in Frankfurt,
and in piano, at these places respectively, Marmontel
and Heyman. An interim was spent with Ehlert in
Wiesbaden. Franz Liszt was MacDowell's friend and
helped him to recognition in Germany. No American
composer has been so prominent as MacDowell as a
concert pianist. His sensitive performances of his own
works served to make them broadly known and to
establish the traditions of their interpretation. The
composer took up his residence in America again in
1888, after twelve years of absence, first in Boston, and
later in New York, where, until his unfortunate friction
with the academic authorities, he exerted a wide influence
as professor of music at Columbia University.
The malady which alienated him from his powers in
his last years, and which finally brought about his end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
called universal attention to America's musical awakening
and prowess by the same stroke in which it
removed the nation's musical leader.</p>

<p>MacDowell attained his chief critical recognition
through his two concertos and four sonatas for piano.
The second concerto, in D minor, with its alternate
phases of nobility and charm, stands as a monument
to the composer's highest powers, with regard both to
pianistic and orchestral mediums of expression. The
composer's harmonic warmth and individuality, his
freshness of melodic inspiration, his marked capacity
for skillful and colorful orchestration, his eager and
highly pitched temperament, are all manifest throughout
the work. Of the four sonatas, the 'Tragica,' 'Eroica,'
'Norse,' and 'Keltic,' the last has been universally
judged the greatest, and one of his greatest works.
Lawrence Gilman calls it his 'masterpiece.' As their
titles indicate, these works are all programmatic,
though not slavishly so, and romantic in the highest
degree. Their material, derived from the rich storehouse
of Gaelic legend, finds the composer on his native
spiritual heath, and in them he speaks with an authority
not surpassed, perhaps not equalled, in the
whole range of his work beside.</p>

<p>The 'Indian Suite' (opus 48) has been the most frequently
heard of MacDowell's orchestral works, which
have, as a class, been somewhat overshadowed by the
piano compositions. In it the composer has touched
but lightly upon his Indian thematic sources, building
from his own fertile imagination a work of substantial
character in five movements, depicting his conception
of various phases of Indian life. The fourth movement,
a dirge, has won great favor through its sheer
imaginative beauty, but the work as a whole has not
proved wholly convincing, and is far less true to the
Indian than the sonatas are to the Gaelic genius. It represents,
however, a matured mastery of orchestration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
and the formal presentation of ideas. An earlier orchestral
suite (opus 42) is a less notable work, reflecting
the influence of Raff, and is seldom heard. 'The
Saracens' and 'The Lovely Alda,' two colorful orchestral
fragments from a once-projected 'Roland' symphony,
are not infrequently heard, and with pleasure,
but, while characteristic of the composer's genius, are
scarcely representative of it. An earlier 'Hamlet and
Ophelia' overture has fared rather less well.</p>

<p>In a great number of little piano compositions,
grouped under various titles, MacDowell has left an
exquisite and extensive legacy of works which mirror
forth the world of multitudinous fancy which he delighted
to haunt. Not conceived with the view of displaying
modern concert technique, but in a vein of
sincere and intimate poetic expression, these works
have been cherished and enjoyed wherever the piano
is played. Reflecting more particularly the earlier
phases of the composer's artistic sympathies are two
suites (opera 10 and 14), 'Forest Idyls' (opus 19), 'Six
Idyls' (opus 28), 'Four Little Poems' (opus 32), 'Marionettes'
(opus 38), and 'Twelve Studies' (opus 39). The
works in this form by which MacDowell has chiefly
endeared himself to the rank and file of American
music-lovers, are 'Woodland Sketches' (opus 51), containing
'To a Wild Rose' and 'To a Water Lily;' 'Sea
Pieces' (opus 55); 'Fireside Tales' (opus 61), and 'New
England Idyls' (opus 62), the last work of the composer.</p>

<p>By no means the least of MacDowell's contributions
to musical literature, either in quantity or quality, are
his songs, of which there are some ten groups for solo
voice, and various part songs, chiefly for male voices.
In the spheres of charm, fancy, and 'atmospheric' intuition
these undoubtedly hold a very high place,
though in respect to passion and imaginative vigor
the same can scarcely be said, despite the claims of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
Henry T. Finck, who places MacDowell with the highest
rank of the world's song-writers. The highest type
of song-writing would seem to demand not so much
a passion for beauty as a passion for passion itself,
either physical or spiritual, and such a quality, while
not absent from it, was not central to the ethereal
character of MacDowell's genius.</p>

<p>Lawrence Gilman's 'Edward MacDowell' presents a
sympathetic and illuminating study of the composer
and his work.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>One of the rocks upon which the high character of
modern American music is founded is the art-activity
of Edgar Stillman-Kelley (b. April 14, 1857). While he
has not given forth his compositions in rapid succession
or in great quantity, he has, nevertheless, struck
a series of telling blows for the honor and dignity of
creative musical art in America. Especially is this
true in view of the fact that he has formulated, maintained
and promulgated definite ideals of music
throughout a period which has been characterized
mainly, in this respect, by confusion and groping, and,
too frequently, even by grovelling. In a post-Wagnerian
period in which vacillation, obscurity, and disorder
have reigned throughout a large part of the musical
world, he has steadily advanced the standard of lucidity,
order, and faith. Lofty in imagination, of a high
sense of beauty, and at the same time exceptional in
scholarship and breadth of intellectual vision, he combines
qualities which must necessarily single him out
as a leader of importance in the musical movement to
which America has given birth. The same qualities
have also fitted him to exercise a beneficent influence,
in certain directions, upon more recent and newly
appearing phases of native musical evolution. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
been Stillman-Kelley's fate that both his name and his
influence have outdistanced the general knowledge of
his works. Two circumstances may be held accountable
for this: the fact that he has given out no quantity
of works in small forms through which his music
might become accessible to music-lovers everywhere
through the universal medium of the piano, and the
further fact that it is particularly in just such forms
as Stillman-Kelley has produced that, as a nation, we
are slow in giving our own composers a wide hearing.
The American symphony, on American programs, must
wait, first, and perhaps rightfully, upon the classics,
and, second, and often with bitter wrong, upon the sensational
European novelties of the hour.</p>

<p>So independent and individual a thinker is Stillman-Kelley,
so <em>sui generis</em> his work, that it can be explained
by no theory of particular or individual influences,
but only by a knowledge of the composer's
broad survey of the modern field, with emphasis, to be
sure, upon the greatest in Germanic tradition. The
fundamentals of that tradition one feels the composer
to have grasped, but of the principles thus deeply assimilated
he makes his own use. In short, he follows
principles, and not men, and for this reason the Wagnerian
'passage,' the Tschaikowskian phrase, which
drip so easily from the pen of many latter-day composers,
are never to be encountered in Stillman-Kelley's
music. Into this technique, acquired through close observation
and analysis of the works of the masters,
the composer imports his own spirit; he has his own
story to tell and is very certain of the manner in
which he wishes to tell it. The superficial criticism of
the day, which looks for raw and sensational departures
from the pre-Debussyian musical scheme, will find
Stillman-Kelley conservative, at moments even downright
Teutonic; but the gulf which separates him, in
spirit and message, from both his precursors and contemporaries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
European and American, must be plain
to every observant person. In this rapid age people
are, however, not apt to be closely observant, and it
appears that there will still be a considerable interval
before Stillman-Kelley's true artistic and intellectual
stature will be recognized.</p>

<p>To grasp the nature of the high distinction which
must be accorded him, it must be understood that Stillman-Kelley's
formative period was that very epoch of
the Wagnerian cataclysm which blasted the individuality
of composers as the cyclone devastates the forest. So
surcharged with the dominating personality of Wagner
was this epoch that it seemed no composer sympathetic
to that personality could breathe the air of its period
and retain his musical individuality. Futile blotches of
misunderstood Wagnerian harmony took the place of
compositions. This was the tide that Stillman-Kelley
stemmed, and his position takes on the aspect of solitary
grandeur when it is perceived that he is the only
composer in the contemporary American ranks, receptive
to the changing order, who can be said to have
come through wholly unscathed. While guided primarily
by a sense of the beautiful, it was through sheer
force of mentality, and standing alone, that the composer
achieved this feat and preserved for his nation
a straight path for the classical tradition and ideal
without relinquishing that freedom of mind which
alone can secure the growth of the individual through
the apprehension and application of contemporary
thought.</p>

<p>The thought can almost be ventured that Stillman-Kelley
was the first composer to use the post-Wagnerian
harmonic vocabulary without the result sounding
like Wagner. If a heroic instinct for thematic development
in the face of the harmonic orgies of the time
contributed to this achievement, it was secondary to
a contribution of even greater distinction. This more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
original contribution may be termed the application of
a geometrical poetic sense to the new harmony. Of
the tyrant that enslaved the composers of the time
Stillman-Kelley promptly made himself the master.
Out of the new material he generated for his use <em>harmonic
motives</em>, symmetrical blocks of harmony, bearing
a particular relation to his thematic material, and,
by the application of these well-defined and well-rounded
harmonic motives to his formal structure, he
attained, at a stroke, the employment of the new medium,
the preservation of clarity and order, and thereto
a new musical personality. He did not recede to an
archaic classical purism and offer the familiar excuse
of those who found in Wagner the ruination of pure
music. He advanced bravely on to the dangerous
ground of the new territory and made it his own without
sacrificing the fundamental classical character of
his ideals and without losing his wits.</p>

<p>Both in spirit and technique Stillman-Kelley's artistic
personality may be seen in microcosmic scope, as it
were, in his highly individual song, 'Israfel' to the poem
of Edgar Allan Poe. Here are the serene beauty, the
highly imaginative harmonic tinting, the touch of the
fantastic, the formal amplitude and symmetry, the
predominance of phantasy over passion, which characterize
all of the composer's work. The companion
song, 'Eldorado,' on Poe's poem of that name, is equally
typical of the composer's genius, though strongly contrasted
with 'Israfel' in subject.</p>

<p>Stillman-Kelley first became known through his intensely
characteristic and 'atmospheric' music for 'Macbeth,'
dating from early days in San Francisco. This
he has in later years revised and cast in the form of
an orchestral suite, composing for the play a wholly
new overture of momentous proportions. This is a
massive and sombre work, dealing with the conflict of
conscience and evil ambition, its murky content being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
relieved only by the introduction of a theme of the
joys of Gaelic royalty, which later on assumes a grim
aspect, being stated in conjunction with the theme of
ambition.</p>

<p>The 'Aladdin' suite has perhaps been less infrequently
heard than Stillman-Kelley's other orchestral
works. In this work the composer availed himself of
certain Chinese themes, of which he made a characteristically
thorough study while in San Francisco (and
which resulted also in his widely known song 'The Lady
Picking Mulberries'). This suite is in the composer's
most genial vein and is a <em>tour de force</em> of piquant orchestration.
Its movements depict 'The Wedding of
Aladdin and the Princess,' 'A Serenade in the Royal
Pear Garden,' 'Flight of the Genie with the Palace,'
and 'The Return and Feast of the Lanterns.'</p>

<p>Stillman-Kelley's greatest recent offering is his 'New
England' symphony, in B minor, produced by the Litchfield
County Choral Union, at Norfolk, Conn., June
3, 1913. In it the composer has sought to embody
'something of the experiences, ambitions, and aspirations
of our Puritan ancestors.' It was greeted as a
work of large importance, needing further hearing for
its full appreciation. The composer has completed
sketches of a 'Gulliver' symphony and an 'Alice in
Wonderland' suite, the subjects of both of which attest
his love of the fantastic and call attention to his equal
devotion to the element of humor. There is an orchestral
score of 'Israfel.'</p>

<p>In chamber music form he has produced a quintet
for strings and piano which has had much success on
both sides of the Atlantic, and a less well-known string
quartet in variation form. There are also a few early
songs and piano compositions. Mention should be
made of the composer's very successful and famous
music for the dramatic presentation of 'Ben Hur,' and
the exquisite 'Song of Iras' taken from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span></p>

<p>Born in Wisconsin, Mr. Stillman-Kelley has lived
successively in Stuttgart, San Francisco, New York,
New Haven (where he occupied the chair of music at
Yale University during a year's absence of Horatio
Parker), and Berlin. He now (1914) holds a 'composer's
fellowship' at Western College, Oxford, Ohio,
giving lectures there and at the Cincinnati conservatory.
His chief teacher in theory was Seifriz, in Stuttgart.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Among the most earnest and advanced leaders of
American music stands Arne Oldberg (b. 1874), a musical
personality of the highest nobility and idealism,
and a consummate master of his art. Unquestionably
as fully equipped master of thematic development in
the cyclic forms as America has produced, his loftily
conceived chamber music and orchestral works present
themselves in a spiritual and technical serenity, artistic
authenticity and completeness, which baffle the critical
beholder. Indeed, it is with the music-makers who
wrote before relentless Beethoven forced the skyey
goddess down into the world-struggle that Oldberg
has the closest spiritual kinship. Never since Mozart
has music been more bafflingly 'absolute' than in
the bulk of his works in orchestral and chamber music,
and piano forms. The appearance of these works, so
modern from the standpoint of thematic and formal
development in this epoch, seems to call for a revision
of modern musical psychology and philosophy. Much
of modern 'pure' music is too dramatic to endure a
comparison in this respect, or else too philosophical
and too deeply involved in the world-problem. To
Brahms' technical system that of Oldberg more nearly
corresponds than to any other.</p>

<p>In this music, at the same time, there is no reversion
to the style of an earlier day; it carries no slogan of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
'back to Mozart.' Trained as he was in the severe
school of Joseph Rheinberger, to Oldberg, to be sure,
the modern French school does not exist, but neither,
for that matter, does the traditional shadow of turgidity
and heaviness which hangs about the Teutonic
genius even at its most idealistic. Those who
think to perceive a measure of old-fashionedness in
his music are looking at the letter rather than the
spirit, which is ever onward and creative, though in
its own way, and without admitting that modern progress
lies only in the adoption of the Gallic idiom. It
is the music of spiritual upliftment and refreshment,
waiting its day until sensationalism and mere color-riot
shall have lost their power to appeal.</p>

<p>The two quintets for piano and strings (opera 16
and 24) present a joyous and upspringing lyricism all
but unknown to the music of the day, together, especially
in the latter and more mature work, with a thematic
involution that would be appalling were it not
for the exuberant spontaneity of their inspiration. A
string quartet in C minor (opus 15) is a less complete
revelation of the composer's powers. A woodwind
quintet in E flat major (opus 18), on the other hand,
is a miracle of gladness and of grave and haunting
loveliness.</p>

<p>A symphony in F (opus 23), twice rewritten but not
yet performed, contains a slow movement that represents
the composer at his highest level of contemplative
beauty. The overture 'Paolo and Francesca' (opus
21) marks a departure from his usual absolutism; it
is a work of large dimensions and great warmth of
feeling, and made a deep impression upon the listeners
when performed by the Theodore Thomas Orchestra
on January 17-18, 1908. The same orchestra has given
performances of Oldberg's 'Academic Overture,' written
for the Northwest University at Evanston, Ill.,
a 'Theme and Variations' (opus 19), and a set of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
'Symphonic Variations,' for organ and orchestra (opus
35), the variation form being one in the possibilities of
which Oldberg has great faith. An almost uniform
success has followed these various performances. A
second symphony, in C minor (opus 34) has followed
the first in F, and there is a recent 'Orchestral Rhapsody'
(opus 36). An 'Arabesque' for piano (opus 31)
shows the composer in a new vein. The admirable
'Symphonic' concerto for piano and orchestra (opus
17), and the horn concerto (opus 20), are almost entirely
unknown. There are besides these works a considerable
number of piano works, a sonata (opus 28)
of great lyrical charm, a very extraordinary set of
'Thematic Variations,' a poetic and stirring 'Legend,'
a set of three beautiful and highly interesting 'Miniatures,'
and various other works.</p>

<p>Mr. Oldberg was born at Youngstown, Ohio, in 1874.
He is of Norse extraction, being of the third generation
on American soil, and holds the chair of music at the
Northwestern University.</p>

<p>Much space would be required in which to give an
adequate account of the creative activities of Henry
Hadley (b. 1871), one of the most spontaneous and
prolific of American composers, and one of the best
known, at home and abroad.</p>

<p>By temperament and choice of subject matter Hadley
places himself in the ranks of the romanticists, but his
tenacious loyalty to the symphonic form, among a wide
variety of other forms, bespeaks a neo-classical leaning
and is scarcely to be explained by a mere desire to
essay expression in all forms. Moreover, while in orchestral
technique Hadley is a student and, in some
sort, a disciple of Richard Strauss, unlike that composer
he inclines, in his orchestral works other than
symphonic, to the overture form rather than the less
closely knit 'tone-poem.' In orchestral realism he follows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
Strauss but a short way, eschewing violence and
holding a rather unique middle course between realism
and impressionism; something more than impressionist
merely, a <em>suggestive realist</em> he might be termed.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Hadley's music is energy, fancy, the
spirit of youth. It bubbles and glints, running an inexhaustible
gamut of varying tints and ingenious and
poetic tonal designs. It is the music of immense enjoyment
of objective life, of actions, sights, emotions.
Too eager and full of action to be deeply reflective, too
happy to be philosophic, it is the part of Hadley's music
to quicken the sense of life and of delight in the
teeming visible world about us. Sombre, pensive, or
bleak it may be at times, according to the composer's
expressive need, but it is the tone-poet's fancy that
decrees it, never a confession of <em>Weltschmerz</em> on the
composer's part.</p>

<p>The first symphony, 'Youth and Life' (opus 25), is
highly characteristic of the buoyancy, the nervous energy,
and the imaginative fertility of the composer.
The second, 'The Four Seasons' (opus 30), is a delicate
balance, within the classical form, of romanticism, impressionism,
and symbolism. It is romanticism that
predominates, however, although such distinct impressions
as those of wintry blasts and falling autumn
leaves are happy and noteworthy features of the work.
The languor and sun-warmed luxuriance of mid-summer
finds poignant and beautiful expression. The
third symphony, in B minor (opus 60), seems to be
less well known than the others. The fourth symphony,
'North, East, South, West' (opus 64), was received
with enthusiasm when produced under the direction
of the composer at a meeting of the Litchfield
County Choral Union, on June 6, 1911. Hadley indulges
in a little aboriginal Americanism in the 'South' and
'West' movements, though his only definitely discernible
'nationalism' lies in his inherent temperamental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
character. The four symphonies reveal a constantly
progressive growth in modern harmonic vision and in
orchestral mastery. The only American composer to
enter the field of symphonic conducting as a profession,
Hadley, in his technical development, has made
the most of his contact with the orchestra.</p>

<p>There are three overtures, 'Hector and Andromache,'
the jubilant 'In Bohemia,' and one of sombre character
to Stephen Phillips' 'Herod.' A tone-poem, 'Salome,'
finds him at his nearest to Strauss in ideals,
even if not in style. His most recent orchestral work,
produced in 1914, is entitled 'Lucifer.' From earlier
days are several 'Ballet Suites,' an 'Oriental Suite' and
a 'Symphonic Fantasie.' The still more recent 'Culprit
Fay,' after Rodman Drake's poem, has won
various and deserved honors. Hadley's one grand
opera, 'Safie,' dating from his incumbency as opera
conductor in Mainz, Germany, was produced there on
April 4, 1909, but has not been heard in America. There
are songs in great number and variety, several cantatas,
a number of works in different small forms, and
considerable church music.</p>

<p>Hadley is a native of Massachusetts, and comes of a
musical family. Among his teachers are, first, his
father, and later Chadwick in Boston and Mandyczewski
in Vienna. He has several times been a prize-winner
with his compositions, the second symphony
winning the Paderewski Prize and one offered by the
New England Conservatory, both in 1901, and the 'Culprit
Fay' winning the National Federation of Musical
Clubs' Prize in 1909. Mr. Hadley became conductor
of the Seattle Symphony Orchestra in 1909 and the
San Francisco Orchestra in 1911, which latter post he
still holds.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the sturdiest musical figures in the ranks
of American <em>arrivés</em> is Frederick Shepherd Converse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
(b. 1871), artistically of strong romantic leanings, although
brought up under the classic influences of the
widely influential course in theory conducted by the
late James K. Paine at Harvard University. A taker
of honors here, as well as at Munich under Rheinberger,
where he went after a period of study with
Chadwick in Boston, Converse has realized a degree
of scholarship seldom attained or even aspired to in
America. He is typically representative of what might
be called the second generation of modern American
composers, the one following immediately upon that
of Foote, Chadwick, and their colleagues. Like all
the active minds of his generation, he exhibits the tendency
to break the shackles of classical tradition while
still preserving reverence for its ideals. With the exception
of one retrospective inspiration, the string quartet
(opus 18), he appears to be done with the sonata
form at about the eighth opus number. Previous to
that he had produced a symphony in D minor (opus
7), a sonata for violin (opus 1), a string quartet, and
an overture. The later string quartet has qualities of
admirable lyrical beauty.</p>

<p>It is in his large romantic outreachings that Converse
is best and most favorably known. Indeed, the
composer himself styles his first orchestral tone-poem,
the 'Festival of Pan,' a 'romance.' Subsequent orchestral
works in so-called 'free' form (an absurd term,
since every authentic form gains its strength through
conformity to some law, even if not a familiar one)
are 'Endymion's Vision,' a bit too 'free' in form but of
rich and imaginative orchestral color, and, better
known and more highly appraised, 'The Mystic Trumpeter,'
after Walt Whitman. 'Night' and 'Day,' two
poems for piano and orchestra, and <em>La Belle Dame
Sans Merci</em>, ballade for baritone and orchestra, as well
as the orchestral works mentioned, have all been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
produced by orchestras and artists of the first prominence
and with marked success.</p>

<p>Mr. Converse has made two heroic ventures onto the
still unwon but yielding field of American grand opera.
'The Pipe of Desire,' with text by George E. Barton,
a one-act opera, is in mood a reflection from the
poets of the Celtic twilight. It was given a special
production of three performances in Boston, in 1906,
and experienced a brief revival, in March, 1910, at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New York, and in the
following January in Boston. A second opera, in three
acts, 'The Sacrifice,' dealing with a romantic Spanish-Californian
subject, is regarded as showing a marked
advance in operatic style. It was produced by the
Boston Opera Company in March, 1911, with a measure
of success, but the scope of its bearings has not yet
been extended. Mr. Converse's most recent large work
was the composition of the music for the 'Pageant and
Masque of St. Louis,' May 28-31, 1914, a broad and vigorous
piece of writing. In general, his music is of
strong fibre, harmoniously and melodically and warm
in color, though his style has not yet broken wholly
away from its academic moorings. For several years
after 1902 he served as instructor and professor in the
musical department of Harvard University.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>A very substantial and influential personality in
American musical life is that of Ernest R. Kroeger,
who was born in St. Louis, Mo., August 10, 1862, and
whose activities have ever since been identified with
that city. The list of his published compositions is
enormous and comprises works in many forms. As is
the case with most American composers, his orchestral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
and chamber music works remain in manuscript, and
consist of three 'symphonic overtures,' 'Sardanapalus,'
'Hiawatha,' and 'Atala,' the first Oriental in character,
the two latter Indian, overtures on the subjects of
'Thanatopsis' and 'Endymion,' a 'Lalla Rookh' suite,
two string quartets, and, for piano with strings, a trio,
quartet, and quintet.</p>

<p>Despite Kroeger's scholarly handling of the sonata
and fugue forms his tendency is strongly romantic, as
is indicated by the subjects not only of his overtures
but of the great number of his piano works, which
touch a whole world of romance from Greek mythology
to Indian and negro folk-lore. Among his more
representative piano works are '12 Concert Études'
(opus 30), a suite (opus 33), four 'sonnets' (opus 36),
Sonata in D flat (opus 40), Prelude and Fugue in B
flat minor (opus 41), 'Mythological Scenes' (opus 46),
ten 'American Character Sketches' (opus 53), and
twenty 'Moods' (opus 60). Widely known as a writer
of songs of much poetic charm and appeal, his best
works in this form are the 'Persian Love Song' (from
opus 43), the famous 'Bend Low, O Dusky Night' (from
opus 48), Ten Songs (opus 65), and a song cycle, 'Memory'
(opus 66). He has written much for the organ,
and there is a sonata for violin and piano (opus 32),
also a recent large work for recitation or action, 'The
Masque of Dead Florentines' (opus 75), on Maurice
Hewlett's poem. In style Kroeger leans strongly upon
the German tradition, but is fond of writing in an
Oriental vein. He has held many positions of responsibility,
among them being the presidency of the Music
Teachers' National Association, and the important post
of Master of Programs at the St. Louis World's Fair,
which service won him an office in the French Academy.
His influence has been far-reaching in the musical
upbuilding of the Middle West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>

<p>Leaning somewhat more heavily upon the classic
than the romantic aspects of German tradition, the
work of Rubin Goldmark (b. 1872) makes serious
claim to a place of high regard in the field of American
music. While having had the advantages of European
study, Goldmark also reflects a measure of the
considerable influence exerted by Dvořák upon composition
in America, having been one of those under the
guidance of the Bohemian composer during his period
of teaching in New York. In so far as this influence
is discernible in one of Goldmark's well-defined musical
personality, it is to be sought in the general nature
of his musical ideals, and only very slightly in the specific
Americanism encouraged by Dvořák (1841-1904).
A firm emotional texture, gained by warmth of both
harmony and melody, and a virility arising from a
marked rhythmic sense characterize Goldmark's music.
His creative impulse is guided more by emotional
sincerity and verity than by the element of charm,
though it is not without moments of tender and limpid
beauty.</p>

<p>His trio for piano, violin and 'cello is an exceptionally
substantial opus 1, and his 'Hiawatha' overture
won enthusiastic praise from no less discerning a
critic than James Huneker. Among his earlier works
are a sonata for piano and violin, a 'Romanza' for
'cello, and a number of piano compositions and songs,
the latter especially revealing an imagination of distinctive
character. An 'Ode to Colorado' for mixed
voices issues from the composer's occasional residence
in Colorado Springs, as also four 'Prairie Idylls' for
piano. From Goldmark's maturer powers springs the
quartet in A major, for piano and strings, which, in
its class, won the Paderewski Prize in 1909, the poetic
merits of the work being revealed in a subsequent performance
by the Kneisel Quartet. The impressive and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
highly-appraised tone-poem 'Samson' was produced by
the Boston Symphony Orchestra in March, 1914.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the first of the post-Chadwickian generation
of American composers to step into prominence was
Howard Brockway (b. 1870), who received a very thorough
training under the American O. B. Boise in Berlin.
He brought back, among other large works, a symphony
which he had composed at the age of twenty-four
and which had called much attention to his gifts
and potential career when performed at a concert of
his works in Berlin. Walter Damrosch once said, 'The
trouble with American composers is they write one
symphony when they come back from Europe and then
do nothing more.' A significant half-truth is contained
in the remark. The classical musical education requires,
tacitly or otherwise, the symphonic effort. Then
come the American environment and the dampening
absence of a market for symphonies by Young (and
Old) America; then the writing of songs in order to
find a way to a hearing; and <em>then</em>, if the composer is
to belie the Damroschian dictum, a gradual artistic
resurrection harmonious with American institutions,
purposes, and ideals.</p>

<p>Brockway did, in fact, give out a quantity of small
works, songs and piano compositions, on his return
to America, all of which, it may be said, reveal a sensitive
and truly poetic musical nature, capable of lifting
itself well up through the dense and earthy atmosphere
of technique into the realm of poetic perception
and expression. The outcome of his return to large
forms it is a bit early to predict. The knowledge of
a manuscript quintet for strings and piano, and a
piano concerto, under his highest opus numbers, 36
and 37, adumbrates an auspicious future for his expression
in large forms. Meanwhile a suite for 'cello
and piano (opus 35) has been given out, and an admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
cantata, 'Sir Olaf,' has been heard. From his
earlier portfolio credit is to be given him for the beautiful
violin sonata (opus 9) and the significant 'Ballade'
and 'Sylvan Suite' (op. 11 and 19), both for orchestra.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An extraordinarily prolific composer is Homer N.
Bartlett (1845-1911), the separation of whose more distinguished
works from the mass that he has written
will be effected only by the sifting process of time.
From the <em>Salonstück</em> period of his 'outrageously' popular
'Grand Polka de Concert' (opus 1), through the
ambitious violin concerto (opus 109), which was entirely
rewritten in 1908, and the symphonic poem
'Apollo' from the same period, to the works bearing
the Himalayan opus numbers 215 and 220, a 'Meditation'
and an <em>Air à la Bourrée</em> for violin, is a far cry.
In providing a list of his works the composer writes at
the end, 'opus numbers here increase to 231, although
I am striving to keep them down.' This great output
shows a steady increase in distinction, and covers a
wide range of tendencies, almost wholly in the direction
of romanticism.</p>

<p>'Khamsin,' which Hughes refers to as a fragment of
a cantata, was rewritten in 1908 as an extended dramatic
aria for tenor solo, in three connected parts. In
its earlier form it was heard at a New York Manuscript
Society concert, and is regarded as representative
of the best and most dramatically inspired of Bartlett's
work. Two movements of an ingeniously exotic
'Japanese Suite' for orchestra were heard at the Central
Park orchestral concerts in 1910 and revealed a
good control of orchestral resource. There are also
clever piano compositions on Japanese themes, a Japanese
'Revery' and 'Romance' (opus 221), and 'Kuma
Saka' (opus 218) for four hands. There are also an
opera, 'La Vallière,' written in 1887, an operetta, 'Magic
Hours' (opus 225), and many choruses, songs, piano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
compositions, including a prize-winning nocturne
('Kranbach' prize), violin compositions, organ works,
and songs. Bartlett was born in 1846 at Olive, N. Y.,
and has been active as a teacher and organist in New
York City.</p>

<p>Mr. Rossetter G. Cole is best known as the composer
of the melodrama 'King Robert of Sicily' (op. 22), to
which David Bispham's stirring interpretation has
brought great popularity. This work contains some of
Mr. Cole's best inspirations; while adhering to idioms
that are conventional, there is an admirable following
of the dramatic line and a real atmospheric descriptiveness.
It is harmonically conventional, at times
markedly Wagnerian, and there are some excellent effects
in ecclesiastical harmonies. In an earlier melodrama,
'Hiawatha's Wooing,' op. 20, Indian themes are
utilized, though but slightly. Still earlier published
works are 'The Passing of Summer,' a 'lyrical idyll'
for soli, chorus and orchestra, while still in manuscript
there is a sonata for violin and piano (op. 8), works
which placed by the side of Mr. Cole's later compositions
become comparatively unimportant. Of recent
publication a 'Ballade' for cello and orchestra (op. 25)
and two organ pieces, 'Fantasie Symphonique' (op. 28)
and 'Rhapsody' (op. 30), are written for their respective
instruments with a well-calculated effectiveness. One
of Mr. Cole's recent compositions is a bit of descriptive
piano writing entitled 'Sunset in the Hills.' This shows
a considerably more advanced harmonic scheme and
one much richer in color, which now fade into the more
delicate tints of an idyllic MacDowell-like mood.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Generations of composers succeed each other quickly
in America with, however, but the flimsiest of boundaries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
chronological and artistic. We now come to a
group of composers, in general slightly younger than
those already considered, who in the romantic and neo-classical
fields may be regarded as 'runners up,' whose
'arrival' is well under way and who press hard for
the highest rank and honors in their field in the national
and even in the international musical life. No
order of precedence will be attempted in making note
of their achievements, as none has been made hitherto
with a few exceptions in favor of seniority and fame.</p>

<p>One of the staunchest and most uncompromising upholders
of a severe classical ideal is Daniel Gregory
Mason (b. 1873). With sureness, if not over-rapidly,
he has developed a mode of expression singularly lucid,
symmetrical and thorough in its formal unfoldment.
Thoughtful in the extreme, modest in the nature and
statement of his themes, he seeks the source of power
in completeness and symmetry of outline, in the bringing
of his themes to the fullest and most rounded development,
and in clarity of harmonic structure. Not
even the strictest of classicists, in these days, can wholly
escape the influence of the romantic epoch, and if a
sympathy with the ideals of Schumann has in a measure
qualified Mason's musical outlook in the first instance,
it has yielded to a stronger leaning to the artistic
creed of Brahms. Some of the composer's pages
bear a marked Brahms-like aspect. These earlier influences
have been broadened and enriched in Mason's
later work by a studious devotion to the music of
César Franck and of Vincent d'Indy, the composer
having studied with the latter in 1902 and later. These
latter influences have produced a very evident effect
upon his harmonic scheme, which presents a conservative
use and treatment of thoroughly modern resources,
though with a characteristic avoidance of anything approaching
to the harmonic sensationalism of much latter
day music. In all ways, in fact, Mason's music is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
a protest against the sensational tendency of the time.</p>

<p>The composer's most ambitious work is a symphony
for grand orchestra (opus 11), in C minor, written in
1913-14. It is in four movements, the last two connected,
without program, and is 'cyclic' in construction.
Another important work is a quartet in A major (opus
7). The sonata for violin and piano (opus 5), in G
minor, which has been widely performed, is thoroughly
representative of the composer's ideals. The
first movement, suave and musical, though not particularly
striking in its themes, is in an extended sonata
form, rather highly modernized with respect to
secondary themes and transitional passages, and reveals
much ingenuity in thematic variation and transformation.
The warm melody of the second movement,
andante tranquillo, is of memorable beauty. The
last movement is in the nature of a spirited tarantella,
with an admirably contrasted theme of choral-like
character, an effect one may fancy to bear a slight
analogy to the <em>finale</em> of Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata.</p>

<p>An 'Elegy' (opus 2), in variation form, is wrought
with technical nicety, but leans dubiously upon an
ultra-conservative treatment. 'Country Pictures' (opus
9), six pieces for pianoforte, show much fancy and
charm. No. 1, 'Cloud Pageant,' is colorful and pictorially
suggestive, interesting in its thematic inversions,
and develops massively. No. 2, 'Chimney Swallows,'
is clever in motion, and particularly in its insistence on
the interval of the 'second.' No. 4, 'The Whippoorwill,'
is a charming piece of classical realism, and No. 5, 'The
Quiet Hour,' comes as near to ultra-modernism as the
composer ventures. Other works are: 'Five Children's
Songs' (opus 1), with texts from Stevenson; 'Romance'
and 'Impromptu' (opus 3), for pianoforte; a
whimsical set of 'Variations on Yankee Doodle in the
Styles of Various Composers'; 'Pastorale' for violin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
clarinet and piano (opus 8); and 'Passacaglia' (opus
10), for organ.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason is a native of Boston and a member of a
famous family of musicians, being a grandson of Lowell
Mason, and a nephew of Dr. William Mason. He is
a graduate of Harvard, where some of his early musical
studies were pursued under Paine. Since 19 he has
held the associate professorship of music in Columbia
University, and he has done much by lectures and literary
work to promote musical appreciation. His 'From
Grieg to Brahms' (1902) and its sequels have exerted
a wide influence.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Emanating from strongly academic influences, David
Stanley Smith (b. 1877), who has for a number of years
been associated as assistant professor with the musical
department of Yale University, exhibits a marked romantic
tendency of imagination, albeit one exceptionally
well guarded by a devotion to the structural ideals
of the classic writers. The distinguished character of
his talent has brought him rapidly to the front, and
none of his more important works have had to wait
long for a hearing. Smith places a strong insistence
upon coherence in thematic development and tonality
as the only basis upon which to found a musical work,
and, while partial to high harmonic color and ready
to depart from the text-books in harmonic usage, he is
unwilling to allow color effect to usurp the place of
structural continuity. Desirous and capable as he is of
advancing upon the debatable borders of modern harmonic
resource, he does not burn the bridges of conservatism
behind him. His music bespeaks a sensitively
poetic nature, sentiment, color and emotion rising
easily through the foundational stratum of a thorough
but not overweighted technique.</p>

<p>His symphony in F minor was performed by the
Chicago Orchestra under Stock in December, 1912, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
was well received. It is thoroughly representative of
the composer's blending of modern and classic ideals
and methods. The quartet in E minor (opus 19), departing
from earlier styles chiefly in rhythmic intricacy,
has been played by the Kneisels in many cities.
An 'Overture Joyeuse' (opus 11) was conducted by
the composer at one of the Chickering production concerts
in 1904; it finds the composer scarcely emancipated
from academic trammels. This and a much later
'symphonic sketch,' 'Prince Hal,' have both been conducted
by the composer with the New Haven Symphony
Orchestra. A 'Symphonic Ballad' (opus 24) has been
given with this orchestra, and also at the concerts of
the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. 'Pan,' a chorus for
women's voices, on Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem,
with orchestra and Pan-pipe obbligato inevitably assigned
to the oboe, has been widely heard, and is a
work brimming with color and rhythm. 'The Wind-Swept
Wheat' and 'The Dark' are also for women's
chorus with orchestra. A mixed chorus with orchestra,
'The Fallen Star,' won the Paderewski Prize in 1909.
A trio in G major (opus 16) and an orchestral 'Allegro
Giocoso' have, like all the foregoing works, been publicly
performed, as well as numerous anthems and
songs. Smith was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and educated
at Yale.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A composer of the younger Boston group is Edward
Burlingame Hill (b. in 1872), a music-maker of reflective
temperament whose work, always refined and
thoughtfully molded, inclines to tints and moods of
delicate and subtle texture. His musical studies were
conducted at Harvard University, under Professor
Paine, but the music of MacDowell, then a resident of
Boston, was the chief influencing factor in his earlier
work. At this time he wrote several piano sonatas,
one in F sharp, one in E after Kipling's 'The Light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
that Failed,' and a 'Sonata Patriotica,' the title of the
latter being far from an indication of any nationalistic
tendency in his later work. These works have not been
published. Under the same influence he wrote a number
of short piano compositions and songs, among the
former a set of 'Four Sketches after Stephen Crane',
(opus 7), containing an engaging satirical pleasantry
on the 'little devils grinning in sin,' and 'Country Idyls'
(opus 10), exquisitely tinted and showing a quality of
charm which is not the most prominent attribute of
American music in general. The titles of some of the
above-mentioned works reveal the composer's discriminating
literary tastes, which are further borne out in
the choice of the poems for his songs, among their
authors being the names of Tennyson, Rossetti, Henley,
Arthur Symons, Ambrosius, and Dowson. He has written
many part-songs to Elizabethan words. A work of
much more importance than any of the foregoing is
'The Nuns of the Perpetual Adoration' for chorus and
orchestra (opus 15), on the poem by Dowson, which
was performed at a concert of the Modern Music Society
of New York in 1914, under the direction of Benjamin
Lambord. It reveals refined musicianship of
a high order and, rather dangerously for the maintenance
of interest, though advantageously for an exhibition
of the psychological penetration of the composer,
sustains a peculiar mood of spiritual aloofness.
A pantomime 'Jack Frost in Midsummer' (opus 16),
which has been publicly performed, is one of the best
of the later works of Hill, who is more distinguished in
artistic personality than in the quality of being prolific.
Another pantomime is 'Pan and the Star.' He has in
manuscript an overture to 'She Stoops to Conquer,'
and a set of variations for string quartet. Hill was
comparatively early attracted to the modern French
school and his later work has been strongly influenced
by it, though not to the point of radical ultra-modernity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
This tendency is exhibited at its most advanced
in the symphonic poem, 'The Parting of
Launcelot and Guenevere,' after the poem by Stephen
Phillips. As in 'Pan and the Star,' the composer's dramatic
instinct comes strongly into play, and the work
might be as aptly called a dramatic symphony, since
the dramatic aspects of the poem have appealed most
strongly to the composer.</p>

<p>Another representative of the Harvard University
influence is Philip Greeley Clapp, whose tone-poem
'Norge' and a symphony have been performed by the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, the latter in the spring
of 1914 under the composer's direction. The former
received considerable commendation, but the latter
was not greeted with unmixed cordiality. Olin
Downes, the critic of the <em>Post</em>, pronouncing denunciation
upon it in unequivocal fashion, though Philip Hale
regarded it with a measure of favor. Clapp is gifted
with ideas and temperament, but is considered not yet
to have issued from the formative stage or to have
acquired a definite and personal style. The forms in
which he writes indicate a strong classical tendency,
but his sympathies with respect to thematic treatment
and harmony are modern. Among his works are a
quartet for strings, in C minor, a prelude 'In Summer,'
for orchestra, a number of songs for solo voice, as well
as part-songs, and several songs with orchestral accompaniment.</p>

<p>John Beach has shown evidence of distinguished
sensitiveness and refinement of feeling in a number of
songs and piano compositions which, as in the case
of Hill, find the composer going to high literary sources
for inspiration. While not original in a startling sense,
there is a very personal element in Beach's music; without
a very abundant technique he succeeds in his best
work in getting himself expressed and is singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
free from imitation, both in the emotional content of
his music and in his technical presentation of it. He
is a true and original melodist, with a sense of beauty
of no mean order which is quite his own, and at times
shows a considerable and subtle harmonic imagination.
'A Song of the Lilac,' poem by Louise Imogen Guiney,
is an inspired little picture of the perfumed and mystic
night wind. 'A Woman's Last Word,' on Browning's
poem beginning 'Let's contend no more, love,' is
very sincere in its emotion, as is also his warmly autumnal
‘'Twas in a World of Living Leaves,’ on Henley's
poem. 'In a Gondola,' an extended 'dramatic
monologue for baritone,' on Browning's poem, is a complete
drama in brief, with some effective and luscious
tone painting. Of the piano compositions one remembers
with pleasure 'A Garden Fancy,' on lines by Rossetti,
an 'Intermezzo' with a very poetic middle section,
a 'Monologue' of Schumann-Brahms influence, and the
'New Orleans Miniatures,' reflecting charmingly a series
of impressions gained in that city during the composer's
residence there as a teacher. Beach comes
from Gloversville, N. Y., and was for a time instructor
in music at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the most brilliant of the younger American
group is Arthur Bergh (b. 1882), the spread of whose
fame as the composer of melodramatic music to Poe's
'Raven' has been almost as rapid as was that of the
erratic poet-genius himself through his achievement
of that immemorially haunting poem. It was first produced
by David Bispham, to whom it is dedicated, in
1909, and has become a universal favorite with his
audiences everywhere. This music offers no startling
problems for the modern theorist, scarcely for the lay
musician, in fact, so simple and clear is it in construction;
but it has an inner quality not easy to describe,
a quality of verity, of directness, of immediacy of expression,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
seldom attained by composers of the time.
Here are no blotches or wastes of mere color, such as
Poe might easily invite; the work is everywhere thematic.
Three themes, of electrical directness and poignant
eloquence (two for the raven and one for the
'lost Lenore'), suffice the composer for the entire work,
with a subsidiary theme or two, but there is not a spot
of tedious or laborious thematic development in the
composition; it is everywhere fresh, crystalline and
crisp. It is music that lives and speaks at every point.
A little tempered programmatic suggestion is employed,
at the rapping on the door, but always with the
musical aim above the realistic. The 'Lenore' theme
is of haunting loveliness, and the theme of the 'stately
raven' is a stroke of genius in the simple expression
of mystery and dignity. Everywhere is poetic and
idealistic atmosphere, gained always with the simplest
of means. It is to the composer's credit that, with a
true intuition for the relative values in the content of
the poem, he has made, not the gloom of the shadow-haunted
chamber, but the dream of the 'lost Lenore,'
the dominant note of the work. The composer has
made an admirable orchestral score of the composition,
which was produced, with Bispham as reader, the composer
conducting, at a concert of the 'American Music
Society' in New York, on April 18, 1909.</p>

<p>The composer has completed another 'melodrama'
of a similar order, on Browning's 'Pied Piper of Hamelin,'
also with orchestral score, which, if anything, surpasses
the 'Raven.' He has published about thirty
songs and about an equal number of piano compositions
and some for violin. Of the songs the 'Night
Rider,' on a poem by Fullerton Waldo, is the most
important, a high-spirited and poetic work. It is scored
for orchestra. In most of these smaller works Beach
has not embodied a very significant content, but they
have ingenuity, charm, and sentiment. 'Plaintive Love'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
from opus 14 may be mentioned as colorful. He has
many unpublished works, among them a light romantic
opera, 'Niorada,' some excellent piano suites, two
overtures, a 'Festival March,' a recent symphonic choral
for orchestra and chorus entitled 'The Unnamed City,'
and many songs. Bergh was the conductor of the orchestra
in Central Park, New York, in the summer of
1914.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Joseph Henius, whose untimely death in 1912 cut
short the career of a musician of high ideals, has left
a published violin sonata of high merit. It was first
produced by David and Clara Mannes in New York in
1909 and was enthusiastically received. It is fairly
strict sonata form except for the slow movement. This
is a romance of deep poetic fervor, alternately sombre
and exalted, and reveals a lofty melodic beauty and
much warmth of feeling. Henius has aimed at keeping
melody plainly in view, and at the same time to gain
perfection of the cyclic form. He was a pupil of
Dvořák and a determined classicist. Among his manuscripts
are a quintet in D major, a quartet in G minor,
a comic opera and various songs.</p>

<p>A composer of classical leanings is Frank Edwin
Ward (b. 1872), who has been connected with Columbia
University as organist since 1904, and as Associate in
Music since 1909. His works in the cyclical forms are
a published sonata for violin and piano (opus 9), and,
in manuscript, a quartet for piano and strings (opus
13), a string quartet (opus 22), and a suite for orchestra
(opus 25). Modern in a general way, though not
in the latter-day sense of the term, Ward's music exhibits
an unusual melodic fluency and a harmonic variety
and flexibility which often lend it interest and
charm. It is music that is sincere and well-felt, and
wholly devoid of strain. The workmanship is clean-cut
and musicianly, and the form well-rounded and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
balanced. A rhapsody for piano and violin or violoncello
(opus 10) is effective and spirited with an <em>andante
appassionato</em> movement of much warmth. Of a group
of short piano pieces (opus 5), 'Prelude' shows a distinguished
and refined quality of musical thought, with
much modulatory interest, and a MacDowellish 'By the
Sea Shore' is very agreeable music. There are also
a number of songs and organ pieces, two sacred cantatas,
'The Divine Birth' and 'The Savior of the World,'
secular part songs, and over thirty anthems and
services.</p>

<p>Carl Busch (b. 1862), although of foreign birth, has
long been classed among American composers. He
has for many years been identified with the musical
life of Kansas City, Mo., where he is conductor of the
symphony orchestra and the Philharmonic Choral Society.
He has also conducted concerts in his native
land, Denmark, where he was knighted by the government
in 1912. His early studies were conducted
in Copenhagen, but his work as a composer began only
with his residence in America, now of twenty-five years'
duration. Busch's tendency is almost wholly along
romantic lines, and his achievements are of a substantial
character. He is best known for his works for
chorus and orchestra, impressive compositions conceived
on broad lines. Among the most important of
these are 'King Olaf,' and 'The Four Winds,' the latter
of Indian character. Others are: 'The American Flag,'
'Paul Revere's Ride,' 'The League of the Alps,' and
'The Brown Heather.' Busch has an excellent technical
command of orchestral resource, and has produced a
number of large orchestral works, among them a prologue,
'The Passing of Arthur,' a rhapsody, 'Negro Carnival,'
and a testimony to the persistence of Stephen
Foster's fame and influence in string variations on 'The
Old Folks at Home' and 'My Old Kentucky Home.'
During the last ten years Busch has felt strongly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
Indian influence and, aside from 'The Four Winds,'
has produced an 'Indian Legend' for violin and piano,
two groups of Indian songs, two symphonic poems and
several smaller orchestral works, all of Indian character.
From an earlier period are many songs and choruses
and a number of violin pieces.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Also foreign born, and famous chiefly through his
long and distinguished career as a conductor, Walter
Damrosch (b. 1862) has made noteworthy incursions
into the field of composition. Wherever David Bispham
has sung, his stirring setting of Kipling's 'Danny
Deever' is a popular favorite. In 1894 he essayed an
American grand opera in 'The Scarlet Letter,' produced
in Boston and New York under his own direction, but
the work did not hold the stage. Much more favorable
comment was evoked by his second opera, 'Cyrano,'
text by W. J. Henderson, which was produced at the
Metropolitan Opera House in New York on February
27, 1913. The critic of the 'New Music Review' wrote
of Mr. Damrosch and this work, 'He has written in a
well recognizable post-Wagnerian style.... His score
is commendable for its coloring, its richness, and for
the touch with which he has emphasized and elucidated
passages now emotional, now gay, now picturesque,
now tragic. The music of "Cyrano" is undoubtedly
composed with skill, with verve, and in parts with
spontaneity.' In the midst of a busy conductor's life
Mr. Damrosch has unquestionably borne his share of
the effort to make America an opera-producing nation.</p>

<p>Two other Americans coming within the present
classification who have striven in the field of grand
opera are Albert Mildenberg and William Legrand
Howland. Mildenberg has written three grand operas,
'Michael Angelo,' in one act, and two three-act operas,
'Raffaelo' and 'Angelo,' none of which, however, have
yet come to performance. His light operas have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
produced at different times, 'The Wood Witch,' by the
Bostonians; 'The Weather Vane,' by an independent
company; and 'The Princess Delft,' by various American
colleges. Howland has also written three grand
operas, 'Nita,' 'Sarrona,' and 'Bébé.' These have been
produced in Italy, 'Sarrona' being the only one to be
heard in America, when given under somewhat trying
conditions by an independent company in New York,
February 10, 1910. It is a melodious score, rather
lightly orchestrated, but not without moments of notable
effectiveness.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>San Francisco, especially as the home of the Bohemian
Club, with its world-famous 'Midsummer High
Jinks' or 'Forest Festival,' holds a record as a city of
composers that is little appreciated in the Eastern part
of the United States. Of this group William J. McCoy
has probably made the most significant contribution to
musical art. A composer of high ideals and broad artistic
vision, of large emotional capacity and wide experience,
his work reveals him as an artist of no ordinary
stature. Educated in America under William
Mason, and in the German schools under Carl Reinecke
and Moritz Hauptmann, he nevertheless at an early
period made himself familiar with the principles of
the French school. His music is characterized by directness
of invention, breadth of resource, and an appealing
emotional warmth, and shows him, as well, as
an adept in orchestration. His virile and dramatic
music for 'The Hamadryads,' the 'Midsummer High
Jinks' of 1904, text by Will Irwin, was one of the
strongest factors in the elevation of the Bohemian
Club's festival to the high fame which it enjoys. The
themes are all lyrically appealing and of jubilant spontaneity,
those of 'hope' and 'supplication' being particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
felicitous, while the final processional march
shows an almost Wagnerian breadth and rhythmic
swing. The overture was performed in New York, on
April 18, 1909, at a concert of the American Music
Society at Carnegie Hall. McCoy's music for the 'Jinks'
of 1910, 'The Cave Man,' text by Charles K. Field, shows
a pronounced advance in the employment of modern
resource. One of its chief features is the 'Song of the
Flint,' a work of strong dramatic power. A grand
opera, 'Egypt,' libretto by Charles K. Field, is the composer's
most recently completed work, having been
finished in 1914, and is thought to be his most representative
and substantial achievement. An early symphony
was performed in Leipzig in 1872. There are
also an 'Ave Verum' for solo, male chorus and organ,
a quintet in G, and various songs and short instrumental
pieces. The composer is also the author of a theoretical
work, 'Cumulative Harmony.' McCoy was born
in Crestline, Ohio, in 1848.</p>

<p>Another veteran 'Jinks' composer of San Francisco
is Humphrey J. Stewart, who has been the 'Musical
Sire,' as it is termed, of the eleventh (1888), thirteenth
(1890), fifteenth (1892), seventeenth (1894), eighteenth
(1895), twentieth (1897), twenty-first (1898), twenty-sixth
(1903), and twenty-ninth (1906) 'Midsummer
High Jinks.' Stewart is of English birth, a composer of
high musicianship, and is widely known in the field
of church music.</p>

<p>Edward F. Schneider, of San Francisco, has also
made a notable contribution to the music of the Bohemian
Club, having been the composer of the 'Jinks'
drama for 1907, the 'Triumph of Bohemia,' text by
George Sterling, which was very cordially received. He
is also the composer of the 'Jinks,' or 'Grove Play,' as
this festival is sometimes called, to be presented in
1915. It is entitled 'Apollo,' the text being by Frank
Pixley. Schneider's tendencies are inclined toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
the classic tradition, though not without rather strong
romantic influence, and find their chief expression in
his symphony, 'In Autumn Time,' which has been produced
by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under
Henry Hadley's direction. His music is strongly
melodic, an infrequent modern characteristic, warm
in emotional quality and of well-balanced and rounded
formal construction, though little touched by ultra-modernism.
Of a number of songs 'The Deep Sea
Pearl' may be singled out for its quality of haunting
beauty, and a setting of Tennyson's 'Eagle' for descriptive
power. A 'Romantic Fantasy' and 'Midwinter
Idyl,' both for violin and piano, are extremely melodious,
and show a sympathetic management of violin
writing.</p>

<p>Another San Francisco composer of notable ability is
Wallace Sabin, who composed the music for the Bohemian
Club Grove Play of 1909, 'St. Patrick at Tara,'
the text by H. Morse Stephens. This, one of the most
famous 'Jinks,' won high favor, and the music, if not
striking in originality, was dignified and of firm texture,
and carried out admirably the Celtic musical
idiom. A wild Irish revel, in the form of a jig, was
one of its most striking features, and of much solidity
and breadth was the processional chorus at the entrance
of the King of Leinster with his retainers. Sabin
has written much music for the church.</p>

<p>Herman Perlet, another of the San Francisco group,
wrote the music for the Grove Play of 1913, 'The Fall
of Ug,' text by Rufus Steele. The themes show a considerable
power of characterization and a lively and
elastic rhythmic sense. Perlet's tone-poem 'Mount
Tamalpais,' was heard, under the composer's direction,
in San Francisco in June, 1912, and called forth
warm praise from the critic of the 'Call.' While not
an avowed nationalist or 'aboriginalist,' he has based
this work upon a theme of the Lake County Indians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
A 'Symphonic Suite' and a 'Symphonie Spirituelle' are
of more recent date.</p>

<p>Edward G. Stricklen is one of the younger San Franciscans,
and is regarded as a composer of ability and
promise. The music for 'The Green Knight,' text by
Porter Garnett, the 'Jinks' of 1911, is his contribution
to the art achievement of the Bohemain Club. It is
music of distinguished imaginative character and
much freshness of inspiration, showing the rich modern
harmonic texture which characterizes the younger
school of American composers. Stricklen is also the
composer of the first 'Parthenia,' the annual festival
expressing the passage from girlhood to womanhood,
inaugurated by the women students at the University
of California.</p>

<p>Theodore Vogt and Arthur Weiss should be mentioned
in connection with the San Francisco group,
the composers of the 'Jinks' of 1905 and 1908, respectively,
'The Quest of the Gorgon' and 'The Sons of
Baldur'; and also Joseph D. Redding, the composer
of the first 'Jinks' known as a 'Grove Play,' which was
entitled 'The Man in the Forest,' and was produced in
1902. John Harradan Pratt, of San Francisco, has
composed, among other works, a trio for pianoforte
and strings, which, if conservative, shows genuine classical
ideals and considerable charm.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Clifford Page (b. 1866), at one time associated
with the San Francisco group, but who later removed
to the East, is a composer of a high order of
musicianship. He has an early opera, 'The First Lieutenant,'
produced in San Francisco in 1889, as well as
two later operas, and has written much incidental and
entr'acte music for plays. An orchestral 'Caprice' is
an astonishing display of orchestral and contrapuntal
ingenuity, and his part song on lines from the opening
of Keats' 'Endymion' shows a highly refined sense of
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span></p>

<p>There are many American composers of the younger
generation, or, if somewhat older, too infrequently
heard, who have shown a greater or less degree of creative
capacity along the line of the ideals considered in
the present chapter, but of whom it is too early to predict
the nature or possible height of their promised
achievements. Henry Lang, of Philadelphia, took the
first prize in the chamber music class of the prize competition
of the National Federation of Musical Clubs
in 1911, with a trio for piano and strings, in E major.
Henry V. Stearnes, with a very melodious trio in D
minor, took the second prize in this class at the same
competition. Stanley R. Avery, of Minneapolis, has
written a considerable number of songs showing fancy
and charm, among them 'When Hazel Comes,' 'There's
a Sunny Path,' 'The Shepherdess,' an Easter song called
'The Dawn of Life,' 'On a Balcony,' a graceful song
with a warmly emotional climax, and an 'Esquimo
Love Song' of curiously chilly atmosphere. He has
written also part songs and church music. Arthur Olaf
Anderson, of Chicago, who has also written many
charming songs, is a purist in his art, gaining exquisite
effects with great simplicity and lucidity. Among his
songs are 'May-time,' 'Roses,' <em>In verschwiegener Nacht</em>,
and 'Mother Mine.' He is the composer of two pianoforte
sonatas, several short suites and pieces for large
and small orchestra, and a number of mixed male and
female choruses. Chester Ide, of Springfield, Ill., is a
composer of delicate poetic fancy who often shows an
unusually poignant sense of beauty. He has written
suites for orchestra, vocal works with orchestra, songs,
and piano pieces. The songs 'Lovers of the Wild' and
'Names,' on poems by Stevenson and Coleridge, reveal
grace and buoyancy of inspiration, and a waltz, 'To
Margaret,' gains a singular intensity of dreaminess with
the simplest of means. Albert Elkus, of Sacramento,
Cal., has written piano pieces showing individuality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
Cecil Burleigh is a composer of exceptional promise,
who devotes himself chiefly to the violin. His 'Eight
Characteristic Pieces' (opus 6) for that instrument are
musicianly, well felt, and fanciful, though not showing
the character revealed in his later work. The 'Rocky
Mountain Sketches' and 'Twelve Short Poems,' also for
violin and piano, show a very great advance in imaginative
quality, as does also a set of five 'Indian
Sketches.' A recent violin and piano sonata, entitled
'Ascension,' is his most ambitious work. Christian
Kriens, of Hollandish birth, has written felicitously in
various forms. A number of solos for violin and 'cello,
with piano accompaniment, show him as a fertile melodist.
One of the former, 'Summer Evening,' is a simple
mood of considerable loveliness. A composer of
piquant and charming individuality is Charles Fonteyn
Manney (b. 1872), of Boston, who has written many excellent
songs, 'Orpheus with His Lute' being perhaps
the best known. Frederick Fleming Beale, of Seattle,
has shown originality and noteworthy poetic quality as
a song writer. J. Homer Grunn, located at Phœnix,
Ariz., has embodied impressions of the 'land of little
rain' in a pianoforte suite, 'Impressions of the Desert,'
and has written a <em>Marche Héroïque</em> for two pianos,
'Concert Studies,' and 'Garden Pieces.'</p>

<p>Edmund Severn (b. 1862, in England) has given himself
extensively to composition for the violin. His concerto
for that instrument in D minor is on broadly melodic
lines, is, on the whole, conservative, but makes
occasional excursions into whole-tone scale effects.
A suite for violin and piano, 'From Old New England,'
draws upon old tunes and ballads of that region for
its thematic material, though scarcely constituting the
composer a nationalist. Its movements, 'Pastoral Romance,'
'Rustic Scherzo,' 'Lament,' and 'Kitchen Dance,'
are excellent violin writing, and show humor and a
sprightly fancy. There is also a sonata for violin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
piano and a symphonic poem, 'Launcelot and Elaine,'
which has been heard at the Worcester, Mass., festivals.</p>

<p>Certain American composers of distinguished attainments
in the sphere of romantic and neo-classic ideals
have preferred to spend their lives in Europe, with the
result that their work is little known at home. Among
these Arthur Bird (b. 1856) is known as the possessor
of a fertile and truly musical imagination and a thorough
technique. He has composed a symphony, suites,
and a 'Carnival,' for orchestra; a ballet, <em>Rübezahl</em>;
an opera, 'Daphne'; and various works for piano and
organ. His decimet for wind instruments won the
Paderewski prize for chamber music in 1902. Bird is a
musician of German training and French sympathies
and calls himself a 'conditional modernist.' He makes
his home in Berlin, where he studied under Haupt,
Loeschhorn and Urban. Earlier in his career he spent
two years with Liszt at Weimar. In 1886 Bird was the
conductor of the Milwaukee Musical Festival. Another
of the expatriated is Bertram Shapleigh, who has
adopted England as his home. His output is enormous
and comprises works in many forms, among them orchestral
works, cantatas, and choruses, and violin and
'cello solos, though songs constitute by far the greater
part of his music. For orchestra he has a 'Ramayana'
suite and four symphonic sketches, <em>Gur Amir</em>.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The classical tendency, by which is commonly meant
the impulse to compose in the 'cyclic' forms, is seldom
manifested by women composers, for reasons which
have been variously explained, or for which explanation
has been attempted. Whatever the true reason
may be, it is, in fact, wholly on the side of romanticism,
with the possible exception of literary tendencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
in the choice of poems for songs, that all the women
composers coming within the scope of this chapter are
found. One of the most gifted of these is Mabel Daniels
(b. 1878), who has the distinction of having won
both prizes offered for women composers in the competition
of the National Federation of Musical Clubs
for 1911, the first with a song for soprano, 'Villa of
Dreams,' poem by Arthur Symons, and the second with
two three-part songs for women's voices with accompaniment
of pianoforte and two violins, 'Eastern Song,'
the author of the text not stated, and 'The Voice of
My Beloved,' the text selected from the 'Song of Solomon.'
'Villa of Dreams' is a broadly conceived aria,
essentially melodious, and harmonically modern in
the general sense of being free in modulatory treatment,
without crossing the border line of ultra-modern
chord effects. It is fluent in inspiration and authentically
poetic. Miss Daniels' most significant work is a
poem for baritone and orchestra. 'The Desolate City'
(W. S. Blunt), produced at the Peterborough festival
in 1913, and later by the Chicago orchestra in Syracuse,
the composer conducting. 'Love, When I Sleep,'
on original verses which show the composer to have
a marked poetic gift, from three 'Songs of Damascus,'
is notable for its melodic warmth. A 'Fairy Scherzo'
for orchestra was conducted by the composer at the
MacDowell Festival at Peterborough, N. H., in August,
1914.</p>

<p>Widely known through her irresistibly lilting 'Boat
Song,' Harriet Ware, through many songs of exquisite
character, has taken her place as one of the most
prominent women composers of America. Her work
has assumed a thoroughly modern character, is highly
refined in feeling and often subtle in its expressiveness.
Among her songs one of the best is 'The Call of Râdha,'
which contrasts with poignancy the worlds of sense
and spirit. 'The Forgotten Land,' another song which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
takes high rank, shows a considerable chromatic harmonic
fluency, and paints an exquisite tone-picture of
a far-away world. 'Rose Moral' has much simple
beauty, 'To Lucasta' fine contrasts of mood, and 'My
Love is a Rider' is very bold and poetic. A true ecstasy
lives in 'Joy of the Morning,' and 'The Last Dance' is
rich and warm in sentiment throughout.</p>

<p>Few composers of America, of either sex, have surpassed
in quality of spiritual beauty and refinement
some of the songs of Gertrude Norman Smith, who
commands regions of inspiration to which only a few
rare souls have access. One studies and regards with
keenest admiration such exquisite and deeply felt inspirations
as 'From Afar in the Night,' with its restful
motion; 'The Golden Birch,' so melodically beautiful
and sensitive in harmony; the somewhat Schubertesque
but quaintly charming 'In the Cloister Garden'; the
joyously lilting 'In the Vale of Llangollen,' on Arthur
Symons' poem; and the mood-heavy and passionate
song on the same poet's 'Rain on the Down.'</p>

<p>An extraordinary record is that of Eleanor Everest
Freer, of Chicago, who has, in a large number of songs,
well-nigh summed up the whole range of the best in
English and American lyrical literature, having drawn
upon upward of sixty of the greatest poets in the language
for her texts. Her opus 22, alone, consists of
settings of the entire fourty-four 'Sonnets from the
Portuguese,' of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Her music
presents the wide variety of expressiveness which
such a task would of necessity demand, but, despite
the interesting character of much of this music, it may
be conceived that a richer musical texture would have
been gained by a higher concentration upon a lesser
output. The music shows French influence and is
laudable for its freedom from the outworn conventions
of Germanic tradition.</p>

<p>A melodist of much spontaneity and charm is Celeste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
Heckscher, who has written a considerable number
of songs and piano pieces of appealing lyrical quality,
as well as an orchestral suite, 'Dances of the Pyrenees,'
which has been very successfully performed at the concerts
of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and
elsewhere. Among the songs 'Music of Hungary' is
characteristic and bold; 'Serenade' is melodically ingratiating;
and 'Pastoral Lullaby,' on a melody from
the orchestral suite, has a haunting melodic outline
and charm of mood. A 'Romance' for 'cello is simple
and effective, affording a good opportunity for developing
tonal breadth.</p>

<p>Clara A. Korn, ranked by Rupert Hughes as a composer
of 'works of serious intention and worthy art,'
has written a considerable number of piano pieces in
the smaller forms, including a suite, 'Rural Snapshots,'
an album of 'Nine Songs,' and for violin and piano a
suite, 'Modern Dances,' and an <em>Air de Ballet</em>.</p>

<p>With characteristic Western enterprise Mary Carr
Moore, of Seattle, composed, produced, and conducted
a grand opera, 'Narcissa,' text by Sarah Pratt Carr, in
that city in 1912 with pronounced success. The text is
based on a romantic episode of local history. Mrs.
Moore is the composer of many charming songs.</p>

<p>A complete list of American women composers would
be of astonishing length, and beyond the scope of the
present work. Helen Hopekirk, of Boston, should be
mentioned, who has contributed to song and pianoforte
literature much of worth, of beauty and charm, not
untouched in its imaginative quality by the composer's
Celtic derivation. Fannie Dillon, of Los Angeles, in
a number of piano compositions, shows emotional and
imaginative force, and a geometrical handling of ideas
and grasp of harmonic construction having an almost
masculine character. She has given a musical setting
to Browning's 'Saul.' Mary Turner Salter (b. in 1856)
is widely known for songs of much fineness of spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
and humanity of appeal. Amy Woodford Finden's
setting of Lawrence Hope's 'Indian Love Lyrics' have
enjoyed a very wide popularity. Lola Carrier Worrell
is the composer of many pleasant songs. A peculiar
depth and authenticity of mood lurks in several songs
of not very formidable technical construction by Katherine
Ruth Heyman. Charming songs have been written
by Alicia Van Buren, Virginia Roper, Louise Drake
Wright, Alice Getty, and Caroline Holme Walker.</p>

<p>With the struggle toward national musical individuality
on the part of the different nations of Europe,
especially with the achievements of modern France,
and with the development of the internal aboriginal
musical resources of America, the creative musical life
of the United States took on an entirely new aspect.
While the influences which shaped the romantic and
neo-classic epoch did not cease, they became greatly
modified. The ideals of that epoch yielded to new issues,
and the general forward movement was divided
into two camps, one seeking a national individuality
for American music and the other a continuation of
the most recent European developments, especially
those of France and post-Wagnerian Germany. Neither
of these two movements was destined eventually to
dominate the field. The promoters of neither movement
were wholly convinced or wholly single-minded.
The so-called 'Nationalists' experimented to some extent
with the ultra-modern technical developments, and
the ultra-moderns could not refrain from some essays
with primitive American themes. It was inevitable
that a broad eclecticism should arise, and in this a
more truly national movement stepped forth than was
presented by either of the existing wings. The will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
for the greatest freedom, essential to the American
spirit, asserted itself, and in its newest phase the nation
is declaring for a complete musical independence,
based upon the unrestricted assimilation and reflection
of every phase of musical influence, within and without.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>No American composer stands forth with a more
sharply defined individuality than Henry F. Gilbert,
and none has given himself with greater ardor to the
accomplishment of something truly American in musical
art. The ultimate stature of an artist finds a
certain measure of adumbration in the absorptive and
impressionable capacity of his early years. With Gilbert
this capacity was exceptionally large and sensitive.
As a mere boy in his teens he had an insatiable
curiosity concerning every discoverable phase of the
world's music, and at that age, while America was
still in the throes of the Wagner controversy, he was
thoroughly familiar with the music of the entire group
of now famous French, Russian, Bohemian, and other
composers, whose names at that time were wholly
unknown on this side of the water, and comparatively
little known at home. At the same time he gained an
authoritative knowledge of the folk-songs of the world,
and made extensive studies into remote aspects of the
world's literature. Gilbert was born in Somerville,
Mass., in 1868, and studied for a time with MacDowell,
in Boston, but he never had much academic training.
Concerning his formative influences, the composer may
be allowed to speak for himself, as he has done in the
following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'It has been my ideal not to allow any composer or school of
music to influence me to the point of imitating them. I have
striven to express my own individuality regardless whether it
was good, bad, or indifferent. I prefer <em>my own hat</em> to a <em>borrowed
crown</em>. Of course, I have had many admirations and
have absorbed musical nutriment from many sources. I believe
that catholicity of education is a thing greatly to be desired....
More than the music of any individual composer;
more than the music of any particular school,—the folk-tunes of
the world, of all nationalities, races, and peoples, have been
to me a never-failing source of delight, wonder, and inspiration.
In them I can hear the spirit of all great music. Through them
I can feel the very heart-beat of humanity. Simple as these
folk-melodies are in structure, they yet speak to me so
poignantly, and with such a deep sincerity of expression, as to
be (for myself, at least) more pregnant with inspirational suggestion
than the music of any <em>one</em> composer.'</p>

</div>

<p>Finishing in his earliest period with the strictly German
influence, Gilbert had also done with the exhibition
of a predominating modern French influence before
his colleagues had awakened to the existence of
such a thing. It is, however, significant to note that
the 'Negro Episode' for orchestra, and arranged also
for piano, dates from earliest days. An orchestral
'Legend' was a companion piece. The modern French
influence appears in the richly colored and highly
poetic soprano aria, 'Salammbô's Invocation to Tänith,'
on Flaubert's text; in the very imaginative songs, 'Orlamonde'
(Maeterlinck), and 'Zephyrus' (Longfellow),
and in the fanciful tone-poem for piano, 'The Island
of the Fay,' after Poe. From this general period came,
in strong contrast, the barbaric and famous 'Pirate
Song,' as well as the delicate 'Croon of the Dew,' and
the 'South American Gypsy Songs.' A strong Celtic influence
now asserted itself, based upon the Irish literary
revival and a study of ancient bardic and other Celtic
folk-songs. The chief results were the 'Lament of
Deirdre,' a remarkable song of intensest pathos and
mood-heaviness; four very individual songs called 'Celtic
Studies'; and the 'Fairy Song,' all on verses of the
Irish poets. A fine piece of American savagery from
this period, presumably deriving from Whitmanic influences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
is the song on Frederick Manley's poem, 'Fish
Wharf Rhapsody.' These various phases finally yielded
to a strong impulse toward a bold expression of Americanism,
and Gilbert composed the 'Comedy Overture on
Negro Themes,' a vigorous and jubilant work which
has been widely heard and has awakened much interest
in the composer. A less important 'Humoresque
on Negro Minstrel Tunes,' for orchestra, followed, and
a massive orchestral 'Negro Rhapsody,' first produced
at the 'Norfolk Festival' under the composer's direction
in 1913. 'The Dance in the Place Congo,' for orchestra,
after a vivid word-painting by George W. Cable,
is the composer's most extensive work. There are also
for orchestra 'American Dances in Ragtime Rhythm,'
and, in another vein, an impressive 'Symphonic Prologue'
to J. M. Synge's 'Riders to the Sea,' conducted
by the composer at the MacDowell festival at Peterboro,
N. H., in 1914. There is a song on Whitman's
'Give me the splendid silent sun,' a chorus with orchestra,
'To Thee, America,' five 'Indian Scenes' for
piano, and other works. Often rough in technique,
though greatly resourceful, and rich in orchestral imagination,
it is to the spirit of the time and nation that
Gilbert makes his contribution and his appeal. He is
the avowed enemy of tradition and fashion, whether in
art, dress, or speech, and a fighter for freedom and
individuality in music.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Arthur Farwell is a composer who may well be called
representatively American, inasmuch as his work contains
elements which exemplify the spirit and aims of
our native art. Mr. Farwell is perhaps most widely
known for his studies in Indian music and for such of
his compositions as are built from this material. He
has realized, however, that presenting as it does only
one phase, and that a more or less exotic one, Indian
music in no way can stand as an accepted basis of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
national musical art. Mr. Farwell has kept well abreast
of the tide of modern music and has cultivated a style
in which its idioms are employed with considerable
originality and imbued with the rare poetic feeling
that is his. It is with this broadness of view also that
Mr. Farwell conducted the Wa-Wan Press, established
by him in 1901. This institution had as one of its
principal missions the promulgation of the Indian and
other folk elements in American composition and the
exploitation of such works as employed this element.
Its pages were, nevertheless, open to all native composers,
irrespective of 'school,' who had something to
say, and its founder has to his great credit the record
of having lent early recognition to a number of the
younger and progressive American composers.</p>

<p>Farwell's earlier compositions reveal the usual sway
of varied influences with a tendency to the original
harmonic treatment that has remained the distinctive
feature of his late work. He may be said to have first
'found himself' in an overture, 'Cornell' (op. 9), written
while he was a musical lecturer at Cornell University.
Combining Indian themes and college songs in a sort
of American academic overture, the vigor of style and
effectiveness of scoring has gained for this work a
permanent place in the orchestral répertoire. Following
this Mr. Farwell devoted himself for some time to
the study of and experiments in Indian music, and
thus follow in his list of works several of his best-known
compositions; the book of 'American Indian
Melodies,' for piano; 'Dawn'; 'Ichibuzzh'; and 'The
Domain of the Hurakan.' The orchestral version of
the last-named work is a score of great impressiveness
and of brilliant color. It has had several conspicuous
performances which have done much to win recognition
for his larger gifts.</p>

<p>The 'Symbolistic Studies,' comprising opera 16, 17,
18, and 24, are tone-poems with a generic title. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
composer describes them as being 'program music, the
program of which is merely suggested,' an attempt, in
other words, to create a form that shall offer the composer
the means of unrestricted expression, while
its musical coherence shall preserve an intrinsic worth
and general appeal as absolute music. In the 'Impressions
of the Wa-Wan Ceremony' (opus 21) and
the 'Navajo War Dance' (opus 29) Mr. Farwell has
made further interesting and effective treatment of the
Indian color. The set of pieces comprised under the
former title contains some very atmospheric pages in
which the strange monotony that marks the Indian song
is obtained by novel uses of diatonic material at once
bold and beautiful. The barbaric crudity is still further
implied in the 'Navajo War Dance,' where Farwell has
renounced almost all defined harmony, preserving only
the vigorous rhythm of the dance in the bold intervals
of the Indian melody.</p>

<p>Mr. Farwell was one of the first composers to write
music for the so-called community pageants. In the
'Pageant of Meriden' and the 'Pageant of Darien' he
has obtained a remarkable success by the masterly
skill with which he has welded the diffusive elements
of pictorial description, folk-song suggestion, dances
and choruses, into a coherent and artistic whole.
Equally successful along similar lines was Farwell's
music for Louis N. Parker's play, 'Joseph and His
Brethren,' and Sheldon's 'Garden of Paradise.'</p>

<p>In his vocal compositions Farwell shows some of
his best inspirations. Among the larger of these works
is a tone-poem for voice and orchestra, opus 34 (the
words from Sterling's 'Duandon'), a score of rich color
and poetic description in which the voice has little of
what has heretofore been known as melody, but performs
a more modern function of sounding the salient
notes of harmonies that are woven in an ultra-modern
profusion of color. The same is true of several other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
large songs, such as 'A Ruined Garden' (opus 14),
'Drake's Drum' (opus 22), and 'The Farewell' (opus
33). In the second section of 'A Ruined Garden,' however,
there is a clearer line of melody over a harmonic
scheme of haunting loveliness. This song is one of the
more popular ones of Mr. Farwell's list, having been
sung frequently by Florence Hinkle and others of note.
There is an orchestral version of the accompaniment
which enhances its rich color effects. In his two most
recent songs, 'Bridal Song' and 'Daughter of Ocean'
(opus 43), the composer has applied in a more modern
and highly colored scheme some of the experiments
with secondary seventh chords that lend such interest
to his later Indian studies.</p>

<p>In some of his shorter songs Farwell has again made
some valuable contributions to the nationalistic development.
Besides the interesting cowboy song, 'The
Lone Prairie,' already mentioned (see Chap. VII), there
is a remarkable utilization of the negro element in
'Moanin' Dove,' one of the 'negro spiritual' harmonizations
beautiful in its atmosphere of crooning sadness.
In concerted vocal music Farwell has made a setting of
Whitman's 'Captain, My Captain' for chorus and orchestra
(opus 34), a 'Hymn to Liberty,' sung at a celebration
in the New York city hall (1910); some male
and mixed choruses, and part-songs for children.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Harvey Worthington Loomis occupies not merely a
unique place in American music, but one which is elusively
so, and difficult of both determination and exposition.
To place the delicate and fragile spirit of
a Watteau or a Grétry in the midst of the hurly-burly
of American life would seem a sorry anachronism, as
well as anatopism, on the part of the Providence which
rules over the destinies of art. Yet it is some such
position that Loomis occupies, a fact which tends to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
explain why he has not received the attention at the
hands of his countrymen that the rare originality,
charm, and finish of his work merit. The court of
Louis XVI would have opened its palaces and gardens
to him, but the America of the twentieth century with
difficulty finds standing room for him in the vestibule.
Bringing with him such a nautilus-like spirit as animated
the artists of an earlier France, he matured it
in an America which as yet knew scarcely anything
of any musical system or spirit beyond the German.
It is, therefore, a wholly amazing phenomenon of art
that, out of materials thus solid, Loomis contrived to
fashion his aerial and delicately tinted fairy edifices
of tone, of a character totally different from those of
Teutons of the subtler sort, and foreshadowing the
achievements of the later Frenchmen with a newly devised
medium at their command. It is evidence of the
purest kind of the yielding of matter to spirit.</p>

<p>Consider that exquisite masterpiece, 'In the Moon
Shower'—a very epitome in miniature of Loomis'
genius—a setting of Verlaine's <em>L'heure exquise</em> for singing
voice, speaking voice, piano, and violin. It seems
not to contain a harmony or a progression with which
we have not long been made familiar by our Germanic
system, and yet how complete the departure which it
makes from the spirit of German tradition, and how
utterly it dissolves the medium which it draws upon to
re-materialize it as the shadowy reflection of a Verlaine
dream. It is not that Loomis has not become familiar
with, and in a measure assimilated, the later French
idiom, but that, without the knowledge and employment
of it, he earlier spontaneously breathed forth the
quality of spirit which we now recognize in a Debussy
or a Ravel. Loomis has also been exceedingly hospitable
to native aboriginal themes and has treated them
in the spirit of a delicate and refined impressionism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
His technique is invariably of the nicest, with minute
attention to every detail.</p>

<p>Loomis has produced much. There is a grand opera,
'The Traitor Mandolin'; two comic operas; incidental
music of most aristocratic artistry to the plays 'The
Tragedy of Death,' by René Peter, and 'The Coming of
the Prince,' by William Sharp, and music of similarly
refined mood to a number of pantomimes—a favorite
form of Loomis—'The Enchanted Fountain,' 'Put to
the Test,' 'In Old New Amsterdam,' 'Love and Witchcraft,'
and 'Black and White.' There are many piano
compositions of charm, sprightliness, humor, and impressionistic
interest, including two books of 'Lyrics
of the Red Man'; and many songs brimming with poetry
and character, among them 'In the Foggy Dew,' 'Love
Comes, Love Goes,' 'Hark, Hark, the Lark' (a delightful
conception inviting no comparison with Schubert),
and songs of negro character, such as the exquisite
'Hour of the Whippoorwill.' Loomis has written choruses
and part-songs, and a stupendous quantity of excellent
children's songs for schools. The composer was
born in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1865 and makes his home
in New York. He started upon his musical career in
the National Conservatory, where he was awarded a
free scholarship by Dr. Dvořák.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>If, thus early, it may be said that the many musical
ideals and influences which have struck root in America
have centred and blended in any single composer,
that composer is Frederic Ayres. The true eclecticism
which constitutes the latest phase of American development,
to have value for musical art, must necessarily
involve the complete submergence and assimilation of
hitherto unreconciled influences in a single new creative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
personality. Of such a new and authentic American
electicism Ayres stands forth so clearly as the protagonist
that a claim for him in this rôle will hardly
be successfully disputed. This occupation of such a
position is, however, a purely spontaneous circumstance,
arrived at by obedience to no theory, but only
through creative impulse.</p>

<p>Without being unduly extravagant, informal, though
logical, as a formalist, Ayres commands his many
qualities for the expressive purposes of a spirit eager
for the discovery and revelation of perfect beauty.
Such a perfection of beauty he by no means always
finds; indeed, his earlier experimental excursions not
infrequently left the ground rough over which he
trod. And even at the present time he is only entering
upon a full conscious command of his material.
Only a keen sensitiveness to every significant influence,
European and American, could have led to the development
of so rounded and typical a musical character.
Taught, in the first instance, by Stillman-Kelley and
Arthur Foote, his broad sympathies led him early to
blend the German, French, and American spirit through
a devotion to no less striking a group of composers
than Bach, Beethoven, Stephen Foster, and César
Franck. A constant contact with natural scenes of the
greatest grandeur, in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado,
has undoubtedly exercised a broadening effect upon his
conceptions. While he has not employed native aboriginal
themes, or even made a special study of them,
many of his melodies have a strong Indian cast, which
is difficult to explain except on the basis of some psychological
aspect of climatic and other environmental
influences.</p>

<p>The trio for piano, violin, and 'cello (opus 13)
abounds in supreme qualities of freshness and spontaneity.
Taken as a whole, it is typical of the manner
in which the composer rises, easily and blithely, out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
of the ancient sea of tradition into the blue of a new
and happier musical day. The work was first heard
on April 18, 1914, at a concert of the Cincinnati Conservatory
of Music, and has since had various public
performances. The violin sonata (opus 15) is of
great beauty and rich in characteristic qualities, and
presents an interesting study in formal originality. A
piano sonata (opus 16) and a 'cello sonata (opus 17)
have been completed. Ayres has written songs of surpassing
loveliness and originality. His 'Sea Dirge,' a
setting of Shakespeare's 'Full Fathom Five,' from 'The
Tempest,' reveals a poignancy of imagination and a
perception and apprehension of beauty seldom attained
by any composer. Other highly poetic Shakespeare
songs are 'Where the Bee Sucks,' 'Come Unto
These Yellow Sands,' 'It was a Lover and His Lass.'
A richly colored vocal work is 'Sunset Wings' (opus
8), after Rossetti. 'Two Fugues' (opus 9) and 'Fugue
Fantasy' (opus 12), for piano, of American suggestiveness,
Indian and otherwise, are striking <em>tours de force</em>
of originality. The 'Songs of the Seeonee Wolves'
(opus 10), from Kipling's 'Jungle Book,' are vivid presentations
of the composer's conception of the call of
the wild. Ayres was born at Binghamton, N. Y.,
March 17, 1876, and lives in Colorado Springs, Col.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One of the most keenly individualized of American
composers, and one of the most daring and original in
the employment of ultra-modern resource, is Arthur
Shepherd, formerly of Salt Lake City and at present
connected with the New England Conservatory of Music
in Boston, Mass. His work, as a whole, is almost
unique in American music in the completeness of its
departure from the styles of any individual composers
who may earlier have stimulated or influenced him.
The dominating factor in his work, almost from the
beginning, has been the will to express himself in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
certain manner, wholly his own, and on this positive
ground extraneous influences have been able to gain
but a scant foothold. Of the Brahms and Wagner influences
which he acknowledges, the former can be
traced only in his earliest pages, and the latter seems
nowhere to appear. His harmony would make any
other German than a radical Strauss enthusiast shrink
with horror, so sweeping and so subversive of the usual
order are its departures from the accepted scheme,
while, on the other hand, it can be said to be very
little suggestive of the characteristic harmonic quality
of the modern French school. Especially it eschews
the luscious and velvety harmonic surface of Debussy.
In both melody and harmony, the saccharine—even the
merely sweet—the sensuous and the languorous, Shepherd
dethrones with the sedulous intolerance of a
Pfitzner and, like that composer, exalts in its place a
clear and luminous spiritual beauty. Otherwise he
works in lines that cut, in chords that bite and grip,
and rises often to great nobility of conception and
expression. In his latest works, 'The Nuptials of Attila,'
a dramatic overture after George Meredith, and
a 'Humoreske' for pianoforte and orchestra, he has
fought against the tendency toward over-complexity
manifested in his earlier work, and has gained a greater
clarity of harmonic texture.</p>

<p>The pianoforte sonata in F minor (opus 4), with
which the composer took the National Federation of
Musical Clubs' prize in the 1909 competition, is a massive
work of great breadth of conception. The second
movement shows Shepherd's peculiar power of evoking
deeply subjective moods; it presents an almost ghostly
quality of the elegiac and has much of nobility. The
third movement makes bold use of a cowboy song
and has a magnificent original melody of a broad Foster-like
quality, but the composer holds 'nationalism'
to be merely incidental to a broader artistic function.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
He rises to an unusual naturalness in this movement,
which, like the others, is highly virile. 'The City in
the Sea,' a 'poem for orchestra, mixed chorus, and
baritone solo,' on Bliss Carman's poem, is a large work
of extraordinary modernity and individuality. 'Five
Songs' (opus 7) are worthily representative and contain
much of beauty. There are also 'Theme and Variations'
(opus 1), and 'Mazurka' (opus 2), for pianoforte,
and a mixed chorus with baritone solo, 'The
Lord Hath Brought again Zion.'</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Noble Kreider, through the possession of that more
exalted sense of beauty and flashing quality of inspiration
which illuminates only the rarer musical souls of
any period, takes his place with those in the forefront
of American musical advance. In this capacity, however,
his place is less that of a militant than that of a
standard-bearer of ideals of beauty. He has the further
distinction of being the only American composer,
of first rank at least, who has found the complete expression
of his personality and ideals through the medium
of the piano, and who, as an inevitable corollary
of this circumstance, has more intimately and sympathetically
than any other made the piano speak its
own proper language. American composers write seriously,
and sometimes admirably, for the piano now
and then; Kreider lives and breathes through it. It
responds to him sensitively and with its whole soul,
as it did to Chopin. It has become identified with his
imaginative quality.</p>

<p>Chopin has, indeed, been the strongest influence in
the formation of Kreider's musical character, and
while, in his earlier work, nothing was more evident
than this fact, in his later nothing is more evident than
the emergence of his own individuality. So distinct,
however, is Kreider's personality that it is unmistakably
present even in much of his earliest music. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
mystery and sombreness, as of an influence of the
North, foreign to Chopin, dominates certain of his
moods; and then Kreider is more of a pagan than Chopin
was.</p>

<p>The 'Two Legends' (opus 1) have beauty and inspiration,
if not a particular distinction of modernity. The
'Ballad' (opus 3) is of heroic and Ossianic cast, restless,
like much of Kreider's music, with contained passion—a
passion which at times flashes forth in unexpected
lightning strokes. A 'Nocturne' (opus 4) is haunting
in melody and of an almost Oriental languor. The
'Impromptu' (opus 5) is a darting and upspringing inspiration,
with a middle section of great lyrical warmth
and beauty. Opus 6 comprises two 'Studies,' both containing
a very high quality of beauty with special technical
interest. 'Six Preludes' (opus 7) are characteristic,
at times Chopinesque, and always fresh and inspirational.
The 'Prelude' (opus 8) is a broad and powerful
processional of great cumulative dynamic force.
'Three Moods' (opus 9) show the full emergence of the
composer's individuality; the second, 'The Valley of
White Poppies,' is a rarely perfect and ecstatic inspiration.
Opus 10 contains a 'Poem' and a 'Valse Sentimentale.'
There is also an unpublished work for 'cello
and piano and a very original 'Nocturne.' Kreider's
development has been chiefly self-directed. His birthplace
and home is Goshen, Indiana.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Benjamin Lambord is a composer whose work reflects
in a striking manner the evolutionary upheaval
which, in the present generation, has carried the nation
from the end of the old epoch to the beginning
of the new. There could not well be a closer fidelity to
the old German musical spirit and style, especially as
pertains to the <em>Lied</em>, than in Lambord's early songs.
Even that restricted medium, however, lent itself to all
levels of creative impotence or dignity, and if there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
a particular distinguishing characteristic in Lambord's
work in that style, it is to be found in a peculiar depth
of sincerity, an adumbration of personality yet to
emerge in individualized expression. This quality will
be observed in the first number, Christina Rossetti's
'Remember or Forget,' of the composer's opus 1, which
consists of three songs. 'Four Songs,' opus 4, fall under
the same dispensation; all indicate a leaning to
poetry of high character. A trio for violin, 'cello, and
piano (opus 5) from the same period shows good impulse
and bold and well-defined themes, but is conventional
in harmony and structure generally. An
elaborate 'Valse Fantastique' (opus 6) shows a similar
energy and boldness of contour. The modern musical
ear must search diligently, however, to discover its
fantastic element. 'Two Songs' (opus 7), on poems of
Heine and Rückert, are deeply felt, and '<em>Lehn deine
Wang</em>' in particular manifests a tendency to enrich
the older medium.</p>

<p>With opus 10, 'Two Songs with Orchestra,' however,
the composer stands forth in a wholly new light, as an
ultra-modern of exceptional powers, and with a subtlety,
an imagination and a rich and varied color-sense
of which the earlier works can be said to give no appreciable
indication. The second of these songs,
'Clytie,' on a poem by André Chénier, is a highly mature
expression in the ultra-modern Germanic idiom,
technically speaking, though in its musical quality
there is much of subtle individuality. The voice part
is managed with an appreciation of both delicacy and
power, as well as the requirements of artistic diction,
and the accompaniment is a web of sensitive modulation
and dissonance pregnant with sensuous beauty at
every point. The upbuilding of the climax is masterly.
The song was presented with much success at a concert
of the Modern Music Society in New York in the season
of 1913-14, when it was sung by Miss Maggie Teyte.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
At the same concert, under the composer's direction,
was heard a number from his opus 11, 'Verses from
Omar,' for chorus and orchestra. Here Lambord adds
to his expressional scheme an effective pseudo-Oriental
quality, gaining an insistent atmosphere with very simple
means. Particularly interesting is the way in which
he has varied the manner of employment of his main
theme, showing a keen sense of thematic organization.
Peculiarly gratifying is the <em>a cappella</em> rendering of the
lines beginning 'But ah! that Spring should vanish with
the rose' after the powerful climax for chorus and orchestra
combined. The composer also has an 'Introduction
and Ballet' (opus 8) for orchestra, a work of
considerable elaborateness and much rhythmic and
melodic variety, one which shows his thorough grasp
of orchestral technique. With the nationalistic school
Lambord has nothing in common. He is, however, a
native New Englander, being born in Portland, Me., in
1879, and his earlier studies in composition were pursued
under MacDowell at Columbia University. Later
he travelled in France and Germany and studied orchestration
with Vidal in Paris.</p>

<p>In the modification of the romantic through the influence
of the ultra-modern school, the musical development
of Campbell-Tipton presents a circumstance
which is typical of the experience of many American
composers whose formative period coincides with the
present transitional epoch. The style of the composer's
earlier work rested upon a broad Germanic basis,
modern, yet scarcely having passed from the modernity
of Liszt to that of Strauss. His work in the earlier
vein is vigorous, structurally firm, definite in its melodic
contours, and warm in its harmonic color. Force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
of personality asserts itself, even if the means employed
are not highly individualized and lean overheavily
upon tradition. To this period belong 'Ten
Piano Compositions' (opus 1); 'Romanza Appassionata'
(opus 2), for violin and piano; 'Tone Poems' (opus 3),
for voice and piano; two 'Legends,' and other works,
especially songs. The culminating expression of this
period is the 'Sonata Heroic,' for piano, a work of
solidity and brilliance, in one broadly conceived movement.
It is quasi-programmatical and is founded upon
two themes, representing the 'Hero' and the 'Ideal,' the
latter in particular being a melody of much warmth
and beauty. These are variously interwoven in the
development section, and lead to a return upon the
second theme and a climax upon the heroic theme.
The work has had various public performances in
America and Europe. 'Four Sea Lyrics,' for tenor
with piano accompaniment, on poems by Arthur Symons,
belong, broadly speaking, to the period of the
sonata. They are works of distinguished character,
'The Crying of Water' being especially poignant in its
expressiveness. The somewhat elaborately worked
out 'Suite Pastorale' (opus 27), for violin and piano,
and 'Two Preludes' (opus 26), mark no particular departure
in style, except that the second of the latter
is so modern as to have no bar divisions.</p>

<p>With the 'Nocturnale' and 'Matinale' (opus 28), especially
the former, comes a marked departure toward
impressionism and ultra-modern harmonic effect, with
a gain in color and a corresponding loss in structural
quality. The 'Four Seasons' (opus 29), symbolizing
four seasons of human life, bear out the tendency
toward impressionism and harmonic emancipation,
and at the same time seek a greater substantiality of
design and treatment. There is an 'Octave Étude' (opus
30), for piano, and a 'Lament' (opus 33), for violin and
piano. Among other songs are 'A Spirit Flower,'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
'Three Shadows,' 'A Fool's Soliloquy,' 'The Opium
Smoker,' and 'Invocation.' An opera is in process of
completion. Campbell-Tipton was born in Chicago, in
1877, and lives at present in Paris.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Arthur Nevin would be deemed an out-and-out romanticist
were it not that the authorship of so significant
a work as an Indian opera, drawing freely upon
Indian songs for thematic material, places him in the
ranks of those who have proved the existence of available
sources of aboriginal folk-music in America.
Nevin is not, however, a nationalist, avowed or otherwise,
but with the freedom and experimental eclecticism
which has come to be so general a characteristic
with American composers, he is ready to draw upon
any promising new source of musical suggestion or
inspiration. The opera in question, 'Poia,' text by
Randolph Hartley, is based upon a sun legend of the
Blackfeet Indians of Montana, with whom the composer
spent the summers of 1903 and 1904 collecting
material. 'Poia' was produced at the Royal Opera,
Berlin, Dr. Karl Muck conducting, on April 23, 1910,
under stormy circumstances, due to the violent opposition
of an anti-American element in the audience.
The composer was, nevertheless, many times recalled
at the close. The orchestral score is elaborate and
modern in instrumental treatment. While Nevin acknowledges
Wagner as the chief formative influence
upon his musical character, the music of 'Poia' presents
little or nothing in the way of obvious Wagnerisms.
It is freely lyrical, often very melodious, and, where not
boldly characterized by Indian themes, is built on modern
German lines. A second opera, 'Twilight,' in one
act, has not been performed.</p>

<p>'The Djinns,' a cantata on the metrical fancy of
the same name by Victor Hugo, won, with the <em>a cappella</em>
chorus, 'The Fringed Gentian' (Bryant), the divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
first prize of the Mendelssohn Club of Cleveland, Ohio,
in 1912. The cantata is composed for mixed chorus
accompanied by two pianos. The composer has chosen
not to follow in his musical rhythms the metrical caprice
of the poet, but to employ the words freely in a
piece of modern musical tone-painting, following the
single emotional crescendo and decrescendo of which
the poem consists. The work is thoroughly representative
of the restless energy of Nevin's muse and contains
examples of the sustained lyricism and melodic
and rhythmic charm which characterize much of his
music. The miniature orchestral suite, 'Love Dreams,'
had its first performance, under the composer's direction,
at the Peterboro Festival in 1914. Other works
of the composer are a pianoforte suite, 'Edgeworth
Hills,' 'Two Impromptus' for piano, two mixed choruses
on poems by Longfellow, 'At Daybreak' and
'Chrysoar,' and many songs of much charm, including
a very direct and sincere piece of expression, 'Love
of a Day,' the well-known 'Egyptian Boat Song,' and
the exquisite 'Indian Lullaby' on a Blackfeet Indian
melody. A piano trio in C major and a string quartet
in D minor are in manuscript.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charles Wakefield Cadman, despite his sympathetic
and successful entrance—successful, very likely, because
sympathetic—into the field of Indian music, can
scarcely be justly classed as a downright nationalist.
None of the reputed 'nationalist' composers of America,
for that matter, will bear strict analysis as such, for
in all cases their compositions upon aboriginal or other
primitive melodies peculiar to America constitute but
one department of their endeavor, and represent but
one element of their ideal. Cadman, nevertheless, had
he composed nothing beyond the famous Indian song,
'From the Land of the Sky-Blue Water,' would have
done enough to prove the most important and valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
contention included in the nationalist creed, which is
that aboriginal American folk-songs may be a stimulus
to the making of good music of a new sort, and that
there is nothing inherent in Indian melodies to repulse
popular sympathy. Like other American nationalists,
Cadman is at heart an eclectic. The nationalism of
Grieg, Tschaikowsky, and Puccini interests him, but
not so much as the American freedom of choice.</p>

<p>The song mentioned is one of a set of four which
first brought the composer into public notice, in 1907.
The others are 'Far Off I Hear a Lover's Flute,' 'The
Moon Drops Low,' and 'The White Dawn is Stealing.'
In his treatment of these Indian themes he does not
accentuate their aboriginal character, but enfolds them
naturally in a normally modern harmonic matrix, with
very pleasing effect. These songs were followed by
'Sayonara,' a Japanese romance, for one or two voices;
'Three Songs to Odysseus,' with orchestral accompaniment
(opus 52); 'Idyls of the South Sea'; and 'Idealized
Indian Themes,' for the piano—revealing various
phases of the composer's versatility and fertile fancy.
A representative recent work is the 'Trio in D Major'
(opus 56), for violin, violoncello, and piano, of which
the leading characteristics are melodic spontaneity and
freshness of musical impulse. Everywhere are buoyancy,
directness of expression, motion, but little of
thematic involution or harmonic or formal sophistication.
It is the trio of a lyrist; from the standpoint
of modern chamber music it might be called naïve,
but the strength, sincerity and beauty of its melodies
claim, and sometimes compel, one's attention. There
are strong occasional suggestions of Indian influence,
probably unintentional on the composer's part, as there
is no evidence revealing this work as one of nationalistic
intention. The trio has been widely performed.</p>

<p>Cadman has a completed three-act Indian opera,
'The Land of Misty Water,' libretto by Francis La<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
Flesche and Nelle Richmond Eberhart. Forty-seven
actual Indian melodies form its thematic basis. Other
works are 'The Vision of Sir Launfal,' a cantata for
male voices; 'The Morning of the Year,' a cycle for
vocal quartet; and many works in various small forms.
Cadman won the second prize in its class in the National
Federation of Musical Clubs Prize Competition
of 1911 with a song, 'An Indian Nocturne,' and one of
the 'Four Indian Songs' was awarded a prize in a Pittsburgh
Art Society competition.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The recent sudden appearance of John Alden Carpenter
among American composers, with work of singularly
well-defined individuality and notable maturity
of style, is a phenomenon which calls to mind
Minerva springing full-grown from the head of Jove.
Except for a sonata for violin and piano, Carpenter's
published work consists wholly of songs. The first
set, 'Eight Songs for a Medium Voice,' show forth at
once the unique personality of the composer. It is
Carpenter's distinction, in a sense, to have begun where
others have left off. He is a personality of the new
musical time with its new and transformed outlook
upon the art. The margin of advance gained by the
most recent developments of modernity, more especially
from the French standpoint, becomes his main
territory, while it would be well-nigh impossible, from
his work, to suspect that the old ground of tradition
and formula had ever existed. Far from his modernity
meaning complexity, it is attained generally by means
of a veritably startling simplicity. It is the <em>principles</em>
of modernity which interest him, and he seeks the
simplest means of their exemplification. Above all,
he takes high rank in the sensitive perception of beauty.
These characteristics are all manifest in the 'Eight
Songs' which comprise the richly beautiful 'The Green
River' (Lord Douglas), a limpid setting of Stevenson's<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
'Looking-Glass River,' a setting of the Blake 'Cradle
Song' which combines science and poetry in a remarkable
degree in view of the simplicity of treatment,
the somewhat overweighted 'Little Fly' (Blake), the
lusty Dorsetshire dialect song, 'Dont Ceäre' (Barnes),
a crisp interpretation of Stevenson's 'The Cock Shall
Crow,' and characteristic settings of Waller's 'Go,
Lovely Rose' and Herrick's 'Bid Me to Live.' Of four
highly modernized and colorful Verlaine songs, <em>Le
Ciel</em> and '<em>Il Pleure dans mon Cœur</em>,' attain the most
modern scheme of musical thought with astonishingly
simple means; the <em>Chanson d'Automne</em> is sympathetically
set, and '<em>Dansons la Gigue</em>' is sufficiently sardonic.
'Four Songs for a Medium Voice' contain the mysterious
tone-painting 'Fog Wraiths' (Mildred Howells),
'To One Unknown' (Helen Dudley), and two poems by
Wilde, <em>Les Silhouettes</em> and 'Her Voice.'</p>

<p>In the somewhat elaborate settings of poems from
Tagore's 'Gitanjali' Carpenter wrestles with the problem
of setting prose poetry to music, often with felicitous
effect and yet not always convincingly, despite
the intrinsic beauty of his musical ideas. The violin
sonata in its themes, its strikingly individual harmonic
intuitions, and its structure generally, is of great beauty
and interest. The composer was born in Illinois in
1876, graduated at Harvard and studied music with
Bernard Ziehn and Sir Edward Edgar. In 1897 he entered
the business established by his father in Chicago
and has since directed it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>An American ultra-modernist of extensive attainments,
but whose work has as yet come very little
into public attention, is T. Carl Whitmer. In an age
when sensationalism and sensuousness have predominated
in the taste of the musical world it is not surprising
to find but slight public progress being made
by a composer whose whole tendency is in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
of a highly clarified spirituality, as is the case with this
composer. Whitmer has a spiritual kinship with that
small group of composers (Arthur Shepherd in America,
Hans Pfitzner in Germany, and d'Indy in France
may be included in it) who, however different they
may be in musical individuality, unite in banishing
utterly from music not only the vulgar but also even
the more distinguished aspects of the sensuously
sweet, which chiefly and most quickly (except for the
rhythmic element) recommends music to the multitude
the world over. Whitmer's music is psychologically
subtle and spiritually rarefied; in color it corresponds
to the violet end of the spectrum. It shuns realistic
and elemental qualities and seeks an ethereal expression
which gives it not infrequently a sense of over-earthliness.
Its salient characteristics are well represented
in a soprano song, 'The Fog Maiden,' an achievement
of extraordinary originality and distinction of
mood. Among the composer's many other songs are
the scintillating and crisp 'My Lord Comes Riding,' the
poignantly expressive 'Song from the Gardener's
Lodge,' the sanely ultra-modern 'Just To-night,' 'Song
from Pippa Passes,' 'My Star,' 'Ah! Love, but a Day,'
'Cloud and Wind,' 'Nausicaa,' 'Willowwood,' 'Ballad of
Trees and the Master,' 'I Will Twine the Violet,' 'Christmas
Carol,' and 'Our Birth Is but a Sleep.' Whitmer's
manuscripts include no less surprising an offering than
six 'Mysteries,' or spiritual music-dramas, 'The Creation,'
'The Covenant,' 'The Nativity,' 'The Temptation,'
'Mary Magdalene,' and 'The Passion,' upon which works
the composer has published a little essay entitled 'Concerning
a National Spiritual Drama.' For chorus with
orchestra is an 'Elegiac Rhapsody,' and for orchestra
alone a set of 'Miniatures,' originally for piano, of
which 'Sunrise' is the most important. There are an
'Athenian' sonata for violin and piano, various organ
works, anthems, and women's choruses, and a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
of 'Symbolisms'—readings of original texts with piano
accompaniment.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>William Henry Humiston has not given out a large
quantity of work, but all that he has done bears the
stamp of a genuine personality and indicates a composer
of rich and sincere musical feeling. One may
go further and say that Humiston is animated by the
spirit of nobility of the old classicists from Bach down,
and shares their passion for cleanness and clarity of
expression. In his eschewing of the more fashionable
ultra-modern idiom of the day there is neither a pose
of 'back to Mozart' nor a sense of incapacity or unwillingness
to join the chase. Merely he goes his own
way and takes his own time about it, and the result is
music that is worth hearing and that takes strong hold
of the affections. In 'Iphigenia before the Sacrifice at
Aulis' (poem by Sara King Wiley), a dramatic scene
for soprano, chorus, and orchestra, Humiston has produced
a work of great dignity, fervor, and beauty.
His themes are few and trenchant, each an authentic
creative idea, and he has admirably, in his music, contrasted
the dramatic motives of the poem. His well-known
'Southern Fantasy,' for orchestra—the quiet
Americanism of which makes it possible to include him
in the present chapter—is based on three principal
themes of negro character, and in general strikes the
more sombre note of negro psychology, though a lively
dance appears in the middle, later to be combined,
with contrapuntal wit, with one of the other themes.
It is a work of true beauty and reveals Humiston's
mastery of orchestration. A suite for violin and orchestra
is virtually, in its three movements, built out
of a single theme, which the composer finally fugues
for a climax. The work is no less beautiful than clever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
and, like the compositions already mentioned, is bound
to take a high place in the final accounting of American
music. There is also an overture to 'Twelfth Night,'
written for Maude Adams. Among Humiston's songs
are: 'Song of Evening' and 'Song of a Young Girl' (both
Sara King Wiley), '<em>Yo te amo</em>' (Rosalie Jonas), 'Beauty's
Daughters' (Byron), and 'Thou Beauteous Spring'
(Kern).</p>

<p>A personality of unusual vigor and distinction of
character is that of John Powell, who has rather suddenly
come into notice through a number of large-dimensioned
works of interesting content. Disregarding
from the outset the classical thematic styles, the
composer yet retains the cyclical forms, almost recklessly
surcharging them with an Americanism of the
boldest sort. This Americanism derives from the folk-songs
and folk-music generally of the south-eastern
part of the United States and from Virginia in
particular. He easily brushes aside at a stroke
the critical objections of the past decade to the
modern harmonization of these folk-tunes. Through
all his work is an unusual, an almost singular, opulence
of impulse, of inspiration—the composer has an amazing
amount to say and the notes tumble over themselves
in his eagerness for expression. 'Sonata Virginianesque'
(opus 7), for violin and piano, is in three
movements, 'In the Quarters,' 'In the Woods,' and 'At
the Big House,' and is based on negro motives and old
reel tunes. There are three piano sonatas, <em>Psychologique</em>
(opus 15), <em>Noble</em> (opus 21), and <em>Teutonica</em>
(opus 24). The first treats of the human soul-struggle
under the text 'The wages of sin is death.' The <em>Sonata
Noble</em> is strongly Virginian and <em>volkstümlich</em>. The
'Teutonica' is an expression of the Teutonic psychology
and is a kind of symphony for piano, in the form
of an <em>allegro sostenuto</em> (sonata form), and a set of
variations which comprise the elements of several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
movements. Opus 13 is a piano concerto in B minor
and opus 23 is a violin concerto largely based on Virginian
folk-tunes. The string quartet (opus 19) is
strongly American, even in its finale, which is a tarentella.
The piano suite 'In the South' (opus 16) includes
'Humming Birds,' a remarkable combination of realistic
tone-painting and musical structure, a splendidly sombre
'Negro Elegy' and a big and virile 'Pioneer Dance,'
on a melody of 'Crocker' fiddle-tune type. Another
piano suite, 'At the Fair' (opus 22), gives us a classic
on the notorious 'Hoochee-Coochee' dance; 'Clowns,'
with peculiar harmonic and melodic kinks; 'Banjo-picker,'
a remarkable art-expression of the typical banjo
tune, and other movements. Beyond these are 'Variations
and Double Fugue' (opus 20), for piano, on a
theme of F. C. Hahr, a work of American characteristics,
and 'Three Songs' (opus 18).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Blair Fairchild is one of the American composers
who have preferred to live chiefly abroad, a sin for
which the penalty is to be little known at home. Fairchild
was heard in New York in the season of 1913-1914
with his choral and orchestral work 'From the
Song of Songs,' which was performed at a concert of
the Modern Music Society. It is a work of excellent
musicianship, though singularly apart from the chief
elements of modern French advance for a composer
who is so much at home in Paris. The tonally 'non-committal'
chord of the augmented fifth is occasionally
employed, but otherwise the scheme is distinctly Germanic,
though without violent modernity. The most
memorable phrase of the work is a little <em>a cappella</em>
section at the words 'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,'
which in its simple lyricism contrasts well with
the more elaborate context. The choral writing is excellently
managed. A companion work in the same
form is 'David's Lament.' Fairchild has produced several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
chamber music works, a string quintet (opus
20), a <em>Concerto de Chambre</em> (opus 26), for violin,
piano, and string quartet, and a trio for piano, violin,
and 'cello (opus 24), all maintaining his high standard
of musicianship. For orchestra there is a pair of
sketches, 'Tamineh,' after a Persian legend, containing
<em>Songe d'amour</em> and <em>Paysage</em>, the score being dedicated
to Florent Schmitt. There are also 'Six Psalms' for
chorus (<em>a cappella</em>) and soli.</p>

<p>Maurice Arnold is a member of the group of Americans
who came under the influence of Dvořák during
the latter's stay in America, and he has lent his striking
gifts to the cause of the romantic-nationalistic
movement. His Symphony in F Minor, produced under
his own leadership in Berlin in 1907, called forth
warm praise from the German press, which found it
a vigorous and poetic work, and in certain of its aspects
boldly American. The directness and warmth
of Arnold's melodic inspiration is equally manifest in
the Sonata in B Minor for violin and piano. The main
theme of the first movement is a rhythmically sparkling
melody showing negro characteristics, although
the composer achieves his effects of negro musical color
without the employment of actual folk-tunes. The
second movement attains a high level of beauty and
intimate poetic appeal, and the last movement, in the
character of a jig, is virile. Arnold's cyclical works are
not highly involved thematically, though formally well-balanced;
their strength lies in their admirable lyrical
qualities. The very pleasing 'Plantation Dances' for
orchestra have been heard in many places, but a
'Dramatic Overture' remains almost unknown. Other
works are a cantata, 'The Wild Chase,' various piano
exotics, including a <em>Danse de la Midway Plaisance</em>, a
Turkish march, and a <em>Caprice Espagnole</em>, a number
of songs, and two comic operas.</p>

<p>The work of Henry Schoenefeld bears a certain relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
to that of Arnold in that both composers felt the
influence of what Rupert Hughes has termed the
'Dvořákian invasion,' although Schoenefeld, like other
Americans, had essayed the field of negro music before
that historic event. The most significant and representative
published work of the composer is the 'Sonata
(quasi fantasia) for Violin and Piano' (opus 53),
which won the prize offered by Henri Marteau in 1899.
Schoenefeld's better known works comprise a suite for
strings (opus 15), an overture, 'In the Sunny South,'
and a festival overture, 'The American Flag,' all of
which have been described by Hughes, as well as a
'Rural Symphony,' which won a National Conservatory
prize. An ode for male chorus, solo and orchestra,
<em>Die drei Indianer</em>, a 'Reverie' for string orchestra, harp,
and organ, and two impromptus for string orchestra,
<em>Valse Noble</em> and 'Meditation,' are among the composer's
later works, and there are many small piano
compositions.</p>

<p>The last ten years of the composer's life have been
devoted to a study of Indian music and themes, which
have served as the inspiration of his recent compositions.
He has composed a pantomime-ballet, 'Wachicanta,'
founded on an Indian legend, the music of
which idealizes Indian life, retaining the barbaric
color. This ballet, in the opinion of Ruth St. Denis,
the dancer, is the first adaptation of an Indian theme
to the modern ballet form by an American composer.</p>

<p>Still later, and of greater magnitude, is Mr. Schoenefeld's
opera in three acts and four scenes, based on a
libretto in English, which portrays a tragedy of Indian
life in Florida. The structure is modern, and the composer's
purpose again to idealize his Indian material.
Mr. Schoenefeld is of the belief that Indian folk-lore
and tradition constitute the most poetic and essentially
American musical material available. Mr. Schoenefeld
was born in Hughestown in 1857.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It is seldom that a serious American composer trains
all his batteries upon the target of a single musical
form, but this is what Sidney Homer has done with
respect to the song. In consequence he has attained
a high development of his individuality in the song
form, as well as having produced many examples of
it, his published songs numbering nearly eighty. His
work shows immense range of character, from a veritable
drama in song form, such as the stormily emotional
'How's My Boy?' (Dobell), to childhood songs
of the utmost simplicity, such as the 'Seventeen Lyrics
from Sing-Song,' by Christina Rossetti, containing the
charming 'Boats Sail on the Rivers.' While Homer
frequently makes elaborate tone-poems of his accompaniments,
he does not follow the modern French vocal
declamatory style, but aims rather at what might
be termed dramatic melody. He seeks an intimate
union of music not only with the general emotional
character and fluctuations, but also with the particular
verbal shadings of the text. German in technical foundation,
his individuality is well defined, and he is thoroughly
emancipated from dependence upon the German
idiom. 'Infant Sorrow,' an impassioned plaint
of babyhood, is interestingly representative of the type
of dramatic song which Homer has developed. It is
one of two settings from the 'Songs of Experience' of
the undying, yet strangely living, William Blake, the
other, 'The Sick Rose,' being peculiarly poignant in its
melody, which is almost entirely constituted of the intervals
of the minor second and major seventh. The
harsh 'Pauper's Drive' (Noël), and the bold challenge,
'To Russia' (Joaquin Miller), are in the dramatic tone-poem
style, while the whimsical 'Fiddler of Dooney'
(Yeats) more nearly approaches being a downright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
tune. To the writing of sheer tunes Homer has devoted
also a considerable share of his effort, with signal
success, as the popularity of 'A Banjo Song' and 'Uncle
Rome' testifies. Widely known, also, are his deeply
felt setting of Stevenson's 'Requiem,' the charming and
humorous 'Ferry me across the water,' on Christina
Rossetti's poem, and the warmly melodious 'Dearest'
(Henley), and Hood's 'Song of the Shirt.'</p>

<p>Almost exclusively devoted to vocal writing is Henry
Clough-Leighter, who has over one hundred published
songs and nearly an equal number of choral works,
including settings of the Anglican Service. Exceptions
are in the form of duets and studies for piano. In
the classification somewhat loosely undertaken in the
present chapter Clough-Leighter would be regarded as
an eclectic. His work shows the influence of the various
modern schools without leaning overheavily upon
the individuality of any one of them, albeit there is evidence
of a considerable influence from the Germany
of Richard Strauss. He lays tumultuous siege to the
strongholds of modern harmony and especially modulation,
in which latter respect he is bold sometimes to
a fault, inclining to a tonal restlessness that will not
bear too much insistence. His harmonic fluency is unusual,
and his workmanship immaculate. Among
Clough-Leighter's most important choral works are:
'The Righteous Branch' (opus 32), 'Christ Triumphant'
(opus 35), and 'Psalm of Trust,' all contrapuntal in
treatment and requiring a large chorus of skilled voices.
There are a number of song cycles, including 'Youth
and Spring' (opus 5), 'Rossetti-Lyrics' (opus 58), 'Two
Lyrics' of Victor Hugo (opus 53), all with piano accompaniment;
'Love-Sorrow' (opus 44) with accompaniment
of violin, 'cello, and piano, and 'The Day of
Beauty' (opus 48), for high voice, string quartet, and
piano. 'Lasca,' a symphonic ballad for tenor and orchestra,
is one of the best and most dramatic of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
composer's works. 'Seven Songs' (opus 57) show a
wealth of emotion and fancy, <em>Requiescat</em> (Oscar Wilde)
attaining a considerable distinction of mood. Clough-Leighter
is a native of Washington, D. C. (b. 1874), and
held organists' posts there and in Providence. Latterly
he has been head of the editorial department of the
Boston Music Company, and has made Boston his home.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Marshall Kernochan, though his output has not been
large, has written a number of songs possessing qualities
of distinction. He is among those brave souls
who have essayed Walt Whitman and in his two Whitman
settings, indeed, he has come off with an unusual
measure of success. These are: 'Out of the rolling
ocean the crowd' and 'We two together.' While neither
of these songs reveals striking originality or more than
a mild modernism so far as harmony goes, they are
conceived with a breadth and carried through with a
power that lift them out of the usual run of contemporary
native songs. The composer has made the most
of the lyrical possibilities of the lines, and has done
well with the less singable phrases by a careful attention
to syllabic accent and duration. 'We Two Together'
has an exquisite middle section and a very powerful
climax, and will require a singer of heroic mold.
'Lilacs' (Armitage Livingston) is a little work of true
delicacy and possesses style, and its companion, 'A
Child's Song' (Richard Hovey), treats sympathetically
a little masterpiece of childhood poetry. Among the
composer's other songs are four on poems by Browning,
'A Serenade at the Villa,' 'Round Us the Wild
Creatures,' from 'Ferishta's Fancies,' 'At the Window,'
and 'Give a Rouse.'</p>

<p>Homer Norris has not been without an influence upon
the development of ultra-modernism in America by virtue
of being one of the first teachers of theory in this
country to receive his training in Paris. Moreover, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
was writing songs revealing modern French influence
at a time when probably Loeffler and Gilbert were the
only others in America who knew what was happening
to musical evolution in France. His richly harmonized
'Twilight' is a song of much beauty, and more daring
than successful, probably, is 'Peace' (Sill), the accompaniment
of which consists of nothing but slow descending
scales of C. Interesting, also, as a bit of early
French influence is the Maeterlinck <em>Et s'il revenait un
jour?</em> of delicate mood. Norris has also a sacred cantata,
'Nain,' and a cycle for vocal quartet on words
chosen from Whitman and entitled 'The Flight of the
Eagle.'</p>

<p>Gena Branscombe is one of the very few women
composers of America who have established for themselves
a genuine creative musical individuality. Even
among this few Miss Branscombe holds a position of
distinction, partly through the intensity of her personality
and partly through her approach to harmonic
ultra-modernism, a field to which most women composers,
being only melodists, are strangers. There
would be no occasion to refer to the question of sex
in the present instance except that when it is stated
to be feminine it commonly implies an inevitable discount
upon attainment and is urged as an excuse for
feeble work, which circumstance entitles a woman composer
for whom such excuse need not be made, as in
the case of Miss Branscombe, to a measure of corrective
credit. Inexhaustible buoyancy, a superlative emotional
wealth, and a wholly singular gift of musical
intuition are the qualities which have shaped the composer's
musical personality. Being a woman, it may
be said at once that structural ideals do not interest
her. Her work is an outpouring of moods, moods of
an intensity and richness which demand a high musical
color scheme. This, not science—though Miss
Branscombe is well grounded in theory—but a startling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
character of intuition, provides her withal. Her impatient
melodies leap and dash with youthful life,
while her accompaniments abound in harmonic hair-breadth
escapes. No considered harmonic or modularity
scheme gives her music its richness of color; she
continually leaps into apparently remote progressions
without looking before, and the same intuition which
suggested the hazard suggests also the way out, which
comes with surprising facility. She is best known for
her many songs, among them the dreamful and haunting
'Krischna' and 'Dear Little Hut by the Rice Fields,'
both Laurence Hope's poems, also Hope's 'Just in the
Hush,' 'The Deserted Gypsy,' and the stirring 'Dear
Is My Inlaid Sword'; the rich and impassioned Browning
settings, 'There's a Woman Like a Dewdrop,' 'Serenade,'
from 'In a Gondola,' 'Boot and Saddle,' etc.; the
sombre 'Sleep, Then, Ah, Sleep!' (Le Gallienne); the
fanciful and exotic little cycle 'A Lute of Jade' (Crammer-Byng),
and many others. Miss Branscombe has
written a very spirited 'Festival March' for orchestra,
which was produced at the Peterboro Festival in 1914;
an extended <em>Concertstück</em> for piano and orchestra;
part-songs for women's voices; and a number of compositions
for violin and piano. Miss Branscombe is
Canadian by birth.</p>

<p>Alexander Russell is the composer of a number of
songs of strong emotional appeal. He first became
known for his setting of Lanier's 'Sunset,' a warmly
colored work, but somewhat over-Wagnerized. 'My
Heaven' (Harry S. Lee) also has lyrical intensity and
bears out the chromatic scheme of the other. 'The
Sacred Fire' (Alice Duer Miller) has more distinction
of mood as well as greater unity of design, and 'Expectation'
(John Hay) also shows an advance in style
and individuality. 'In Fountain Court' (Arthur Symons)
is perhaps his most mature and characteristic
expression. Among other songs are 'Elegy on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
Death of a Mad Dog' (Goldsmith), 'The Prayer Perfect'
(Riley), 'My True Love Lies Asleep' (Lizette
Reese), and 'A Gypsy Song' (Braley). Russell's work
shows chiefly the influence of the modern German
school.</p>

<p>James Philip Dunn is a militant ultra-modern realist.
He was first known by an extremely vigorous quintet
for pianoforte and strings, in G minor, which was
heard at one of the concerts of the New York Manuscript
Society. It is of considerable thematic, and particularly
of dramatic, interest, though scarcely revealing
a settled style. Strauss, Wagner, Tschaikowsky, and
Puccini have all influenced him strongly, with Strauss
leading, but what ultimate personality will issue from
this strenuously boiling melting-pot it is too early to
say. The far from bashful realism of Dunn's setting
of Poe's 'Annabel Lee,' for voice and orchestra, which
was sung by Frank Ormsby at a People's Symphony
Concert in the season of 1913-14, somewhat shocked the
sensibilities of the critics, for futurism was still merely
a name (Schoenberg's quartet not yet having arrived
on the scene) and realism could still hold terrors for
the sensitive. The goal of realism is the stage, and so
in fact Dunn's latest works are designed for the theatre.
They are called 'Lyric Scenes' and consist of two short
and superlatively intense musical stage episodes, 'The
Fountain,' after Charles McMillan, and the grewsome
'A Kiss in the Dark,' after Maurice Lavelle. They are
truly amazing in musical structure and emotional content
and may well be considered to represent the <em>dernier
cri</em> in realism, after which can come only the deluge—or
futurism. The composer has also a sonata
for violin and piano in G major and a piano tarantella
and minuet.</p>

<p>Alexander Hull, whose great quantity of work is
accessible as yet only through one book of ten songs,
is a composer who is likely to be heard more of in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
the future. These songs reveal influences ranging from
Schubert to Hugo Wolf, but, of much greater importance,
they reveal also a richly endowed creative musical
personality, even if one that has only begun to
find itself in terms of a matured art. One will look
far for a clearer spiritual beauty than that of the
'Wanderer's Night Song' (Goethe), or for a fleeting
spontaneity and dissolving charm surpassing that of
the little 'Blue, Blue, Floweret Mine.' 'My Love Is
Lovelier than the Sprays' (Ezra Pound) has moments
of magical and haunting beauty, though it runs the risk
that Hull not infrequently takes of sacrificing simplicity
and clarity of the voice part to harmonic interest
in the accompaniment. 'Within the Convent Close'
(Wilbur Underwood) reveals the composer's power to
establish and maintain a mood and it also hints at
the unexploited possibilities of the secondary seventh
chords. Hull experiments; he is quite willing to be
unsuccessful, but he insists upon the essay and is thus
strongly creative. He admits many influences, and
therefore will find his own mature style tardily. He
has written over one hundred songs, a symphony, a
suite for string orchestra, a fantasia for orchestra with
piano, violin compositions, a suite for piano, a piano
sonata, choral, and other works.</p>

<p>A. Walter Kramer has put out a considerable number
of works in small forms, ranging in tendency from
the earlier to the later German and deriving influence
occasionally from French sources. He is an eclectic,
but from the German standpoint. His works are chiefly
songs and string pieces. Among the former are: 'I
Dreamed and Wept a-Dreaming' (Heine), very German
in scheme, albeit sufficiently modern; 'In Dreams'
(Prudhomme), a work of ultra-modern tendencies
which follows its title well and successfully establishes
its mood; 'Come to Me' (Christina Rossetti), a mood
of spiritual exaltation, which presents an avoidance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
of traditional harmonic formulæ not always to be
found in Kramer's music; the languorous and somewhat
Debussyish 'A Nocturne,' and 'Bes' ob All,' a
song in negro character based upon a melody originally
composed for violin, which suggests MacDowell in
mood-quality. For violin and piano is the characteristic
<em>Intermède Arabe</em>, a fervent 'Elegy' of melodic
warmth and breadth, and other works. Beyond these
are works for piano, 'cello and piano, string orchestra,
organ, and a number of part-songs.</p>

<p>So rapidly and in such numbers do new American
composers appear in these days that both omission
and disproportion must occur in dealing with the coming
generation in any such chapter as the present.
A few names may be mentioned, however, of composers
who have given indications of having serious
aims. Francis Hendricks has written piano compositions
that are not without charm and modernity of
style, as well as songs. Charles T. Griffes, in songs and
piano pieces, has shown a refined appreciation of modern
ideals. Deems Taylor was heard at the MacDowell
Festival in 1914, with an admirable ballad, 'The Highwayman,'
for solo baritone, women's chorus, and orchestra.
At the same festival was heard a prelude by
Edward Ballantine to Herman Hagedorn's play 'The
Delectable Forest,' a work regarded as subtle and imaginative,
and two movements of Lewis M. Isaacs' ballet
suite, 'Atalanta.' Chalmers Clifton's suite for trumpet
and orchestra has been heard at a MacDowell Festival.
Leo Ornstein, in his 'Preludes' and 'Impressions
of Notre Dame,' for piano, has out-moded Schoenberg
and Stravinsky and inaugurated the school of post-futurism.</p>

<p>American nationalists are not to be sought exclusively
among the native-born, as the example of
Dvořák shows. Carlos Troyer, an Alsatian of long
residence in America, has made a significant contribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
to the nationalistic phase of native music in his
songs of the Zuñi Indians, collected during his sojourns
with that extraordinary tribe. Among them are
the 'Zuñian Lullaby,' 'Sunrise Call of the Zuñis,' 'The
Coming of Montezuma,' 'Great Rain Dance of the
Zuñis,' 'Festive Sun Dance,' and 'Hymn to the Sun.'
If Troyer has not escaped Germanizing the accompaniments
of these songs, neither has he obscured their
essential character.</p>

<p>On the side of negro music contributions of great
value have been made by two gifted representatives of
the race, Harry Burleigh and Will Marion Cook. Burleigh
is known by a number of original songs, sincere
in their feeling and of much melodic and harmonic
appeal, among them the favorite 'Jean' and the very
passionate 'Elysium.' In 'Plantation Melodies Old and
New' he has given excellent settings to seven highly
characteristic negro songs, two of them, 'My Merlindy
Brown' and 'Negro Lullaby,' being original, poems for
the group being provided by R. E. Phillips, J. E. Campbell,
and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Of much original
poetic fancy, as well as valuable in its presentation
of various negro motives in effective development, is
his piano suite, 'In the Southland,' which has MacDowellish
touches about it. There are also 'Saracen
Songs,' 'Five Songs of Lawrence Hope,' and arrangements
of songs in H. E. Krehbiel's book, 'Afro-American
Folk Songs.'</p>

<p>The work of Will Marion Cook presents some quite
extraordinary qualities and in part deals with characteristics
of the negro which have hitherto found little
or no expression in terms of modern musical art. Such
a thing as his song, 'A Negro Sermon,' was certainly
never set forth in print before. It reflects the quintessence
of the drollery and humor of the primitive negro
in religion, and follows with prodigious alertness his
swift and erratic, though deeply sincere, zig-zaggings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
thought and mood. It is an altogether amazing production,
a psychological musical achievement. The
same is to be said of 'An Explanation,' a negro court
scene in the form of a song. From such unusual works
as these to straightforward ragtime Cook's songs cover
a wide range of style. The 'Rain Song' is whimsical
and forceful, with elemental emotion and impulse, and
'Swim Along' is full of instinctive joy of life.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>No composer in America has so completely arrived
at an authentic and mature musical individuality along
the line of ultra-modern European developments as
Charles Martin Loeffler. Though of Alsatian birth, his
long residence in this country has identified him with
American musical life. Too much the artist to theorize
about his art, he has enunciated no creed, although he
has been known to suggest the idea that the composer's
musical personality is largely constituted by the assimilation
of all that is sympathetic to him in the range
of his musical observation. Applying this principle
to his own work, it is plain that his closest affiliation
is with the school of modern France, although the work
of no American composer is less closely identified than
his with that of any one individual of the modern
French group. There speaks through Loeffler's music
a distinct personality, one that lives upon a high plane
of poetic imagination, and whose intuitions are subtle
and refined in a wholly extraordinary degree. Here
is no convenient falling back upon modish scale effects
or generic modern harmonies, but a pressing forward
to the keenest and most poignant individualism. If it
is an individuality that insists upon a veritable aristocracy
of emotional and psychological subtlety, a total
repudiation of the primitive passions which bind certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
great composers to mother earth and lead them to
brave the charge of occasional banality, on the other
hand, it is one which gives an intense and unvitiated
delight to those minds which are able to follow its
excursions into the remote and unwonted regions of
the soul. 'Tuneful' Loeffler's music cannot be called,
but it sings constantly in its own preordained and peculiar
way, and its motives are often haunting and always
distinguished. Loeffler's literary researches are
incredible in extent and singularity, and have undoubtedly
had a far-reaching effect upon the character of
his genius, as has also his intimate knowledge of and
devotion to the Gregorian chant, of the austere arcanum
of which he is a supreme master. He is a consummate
master of orchestration and his orchestral works have
been heard with most of the great orchestras of the
world.</p>

<p>His serious claims as a composer were first made
known through his <em>Veillées de l'Ukraine</em>, for violin
and orchestra, a suite based upon tales by Gogol, which
was heard in Boston, with the composer as soloist, in
1891, although an earlier string quartet in A minor had
been previously heard in Philadelphia. A sextet for
two violins, two violas, and two 'cellos next came into
notice, and after that a 'Fantastic' concerto for 'cello
and orchestra. The 'Divertimento in A Minor,' for
violin and orchestra, the composer played at a Boston
symphony concert in 1895. Loeffler's fame has rested
chiefly upon his remarkably imaginative tone-poems,
<em>La Mort de Tintagiles</em>, after Maeterlinck, <em>La Bonne
Chanson</em> and <em>La Villanelle du Diable</em>, after Verlaine
and Rollinat, respectively, and the 'Pagan Poem,' after
Virgil, which includes a piano and three trumpets behind
the scenes. The songs are exquisite reflections of
the composer's subtle imagination; among them are:
<em>Harmonies du Soir</em>, <em>Dansons la Gigue</em>, <em>La Cloche fêlée</em>,
<em>Timbres Oubliés</em>, 'The Hosting of the Sidhe,' 'The Host<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
of the Air,' and 'To Helen.' There are also an octet
for strings, clarinets, and harp; a quintet for three violins,
viola, and 'cello; two rhapsodies for oboe, viola,
and piano; 'By the Waters of Babylon,' for women's
chorus, two flutes, 'cello, harp, and organ; and other
works. The composer was for many years second concert
master of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and
makes his home in Boston and Medfield, Mass.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Extreme ultra-modernism, stopping, however, on the
hither side of futurism, has not been pushed farther
in America than in the very remarkable work of Carl
Engel. Except that he is himself, he might be regarded
as a disciple of Loeffler. His published work consists
of several groups of songs, in which the voice is treated
in the modern French mode of lyrical declamation
over an accompanying tone-poem of high refinement
of mood, a positively diabolical ingenuity and subtlety
of invention, and impeccable technical finish. In this
scheme—determined by the most recent Gallic influences—Engel
goes his individual way, producing work
that is always interesting and often unusual in both
originality and beauty. Of the six <em>Chansons intimes</em>,
on poems by Jean Moréas, one is struck particularly by
<em>A l'Océan</em>, which is extraordinarily bold in its assertion
of tragic oceanic emotion. <em>Rions</em> is a fine piece of
bitter ultra-modern irony—a companion piece to Loeffler's
<em>Dansons la Gigue</em>. <em>Trois Epigrammes</em>, on poems
by Paul Mariéton, have much of poignancy and eloquence
and weave a dizzying web of ingenious ultra-modernism.
One thinks—how far from Americanism
is this remarkable work! Of 'Two Lyrics,' poems by
Amy Lowell, 'The Sea Shell' is of most ingratiating
charm, particularly with respect to its lilting motion;
and here the composer has allowed himself to write a
<em>tune</em>! 'Three Sonnets' present <em>Lecture du Soir</em> (Chantavoine),
an excellent example of Engel's capacity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
originality, <em>Dors, ma Belle</em> (Marsolleau), and <em>En Voiture</em>
(Ajalbert), all of recent date. 'Four Lyrics'
(poems by Cora Fabbri) are earlier songs and show
the composer's point of departure.</p>

<p>Another extreme ultra-modern of Gallic musical
sympathies is Henry Eichheim, who is known by a
group of 'Seven Songs,' a showing not great in quantity
but of a quality revealing at once a convincing distinction
of achievement. It is not, however, the emotional
refinements of the French poets to which Eichheim
responds, but to the alluring and shadowy tints
of the 'Celtic Twilight.' From Yeats he has chosen
'The Heart of the Woman' and 'Aedh Wishes His Beloved
were Dead'; from Fiona Macleod, 'When the
Dew is Falling,' 'The Undersong,' 'Across the Silent
Stream,' and 'The Lament of Ian the Proud'; while he
has made a single departure in the 'Autumn Song' of
Rossetti. Individual and subtly felt as these songs are,
Eichheim is concerned not so much with sheer or extreme
ingenuity of means as with the attainment of
the expression of deep and dreamful moods, modern
in poetic expression, and hence demanding an equally
modern musical treatment. This the composer gives
them, finding a deeply sincere expression through the
highly modern means employed. Perhaps the most
eloquent of the 'Seven Songs' is 'Aedh Wishes His Beloved
were Dead,' its solemn march of rich harmonic
progressions conveying an emotion of singular depth
and beauty. Eichheim has also written three symphonic
poems.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Victor Herbert has made departures into the realms
of serious music, notably of late years, in two grand
operas, 'Natoma,' in three acts, and 'Madeleine.' 'Natoma,'
the text of which is by Joseph D. Redding, was
first produced on February 23, 1911, in Philadelphia
and subsequently in New York and Chicago. It deals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
with a story of Spanish and Indian life in California
in the early part of the last century. The opera has
had a very considerable measure of success and reveals
Herbert's skillful handling of the orchestra, his
power in broad concerted forms, and his unsuspected
knowledge of Indian music. 'Madeleine,' produced at
the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, in the season
of 1913-14, was not regarded with an equal favor.</p>

<p>Besides some already included in this chapter there
are other composers of foreign birth who either live or
have sojourned here, as well as American composers
who have preferred to live chiefly abroad.</p>

<p>Walter Morse Rummel, who makes his home in Berlin
and Paris, has made for himself an individual and
significant place in modern music. The tonal emancipation
which Debussy gained through a basic devotion
to the Gregorian chant, Rummel with increasing success
seeks and finds in certain mediæval songs of the
folk, in particular those of the troubadours of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. His earlier works,
for example the 'Five Songs,' dating from 1906, seem
conventional in scheme, although one notes their essential
refinement and <em>esprit</em>. The 'Ten Songs for Children,
Young and Old,' are of another stamp. Innocently
simple in appearance, they reveal on closer observation
all the sophistication of a profound devotee
of the ecclesiastical modes, or, it may be, the spontaneous
utterance of one with whom these have become
'second nature.' Like 'Alice in Wonderland,' they will
speak with equal pertinence to children and grown-ups.
'A Fairy Suite,' for piano, being 'Five Short Stories Preceded
by a Prologue and Followed by a Moral,' are an
achievement of similar intent, scintillating with fancy,
charm, humor, and modern interest. As the 'Prologue'
and 'Moral' are practically identical, the purpose of
the latter would seem to be to exhort us always, in
art, to return to our main subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span></p>

<p>'Hesternæ Rosæ' consists of a collection of troubadour
and other mediæval songs, rhythmically reconstructed
from the original neumes, and hence hypothetical.
They are profoundly interesting and merit close
study. Rummel has composed also a quartet for
strings, a violin sonata, for piano a 'Prelude,' 'Sea
Voices,' and 'Seven Little Impressions for a Simple
Mind,' and many songs.</p>

<p>Hugo Kaun, an American resident of Berlin, has been
a prodigious producer, his work being in keeping with
the modern German musical scheme. He has much
structural power, a fertile imagination, and a considerable
sense of beauty. His chief works are three symphonies,
a piano concerto, a violin concerto, a <em>Fantasiestück</em>
for violin, eight chamber music works, five
symphonic poems, and an enormous quantity of songs,
the best known, perhaps, being 'My Native Land,' and
many short piano pieces. He has also written two oratorios,
the most important being 'Mother Earth.'</p>

<p>Paul Allen, of Boston, has lived chiefly in Italy,
where, as one would expect, he has produced operas.
Two of these are 'The Philtre' and 'Milda,' each in one
act. They follow the modern Italian operatic scheme
and show the composer's close sympathy with the
spirit of modern Italian stage music. He has written
extensively for the piano also, among his writings in
this form being an <em>Alla Tarantella</em>, an excellent and
refined little work, sensitive to the genius of Italian
folk-music, and a 'Meditation' having remarkable depth
of feeling, a work emerging from a real emotion and
expressed in unusually beautiful terms.</p>

<p>Kurt Schindler, of German birth, and latterly a resident
of New York, has put out about twenty-five songs
possessing charm and simplicity, though not of a very
strong modernity. One of the best, and a work of
true beauty, is the 'Faery Song' on Keats' poem. 'Adoration'
is another of the Keats group, and in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
group the composer has set poems of Wilde, Swinburne,
and—a strange third to companion such a pair—Meredith.
He has also 'Five Folk-Song Paraphrases,'
the originals drawn from Italy, Russia, and France.</p>

<p>Platon Brounoff, a Russian living in New York, has
composed, among other works, an overture, 'Russia,'
which has been performed at the Central Park concerts
under Arnold Volpe's direction, and a characteristic
piano suite, 'In the Village.'</p>

<p>The <em>Suite Fantastique</em> for piano and orchestra by
the pianist Ernest Schelling has been heard in New
York. It is a clever and brilliant work, and makes
ingenious use of 'Yankee Doodle,' 'Dixie,' and the
'Swanee River.'</p>

<p>Arthur Fickenscher, at present living in Berlin, has
developed a highly refined and highly modernized art
of which more is likely to be heard later. One of his
most important works is a setting of Rossetti's 'Willowwood'
for chorus and orchestra.</p>

present state of theatrical music.</p>
</div>


<p>It cannot be too often reiterated that, however
highly developed an art a nation's music may become,
it inevitably springs from the germ of popular expression
that voices itself in the simple songs of its masses,
the folk-music. In this lies the essence of its being and
to this it owes its vitality. America's history has been
such as to deprive her in a great measure of a folk-music
in the true sense of the word. Many causes have
contributed to this; the decidedly non-idyllic character
of its early phases and the suppressing hand of Puritanism
were undoubtedly potent factors, but the fundamental
reason lies in the absence of a national consciousness,
which is necessarily lacking in a country
of mixed peoples developing a borrowed civilization.
Now that America is able to boast the beginnings of
a sophisticated art, it is beginning to be more deplored
that there is not present the rich vein of folk-music
to lend to our native art that vital and distinctive touch
that should give it its place among the nation's music.</p>

<p>The course of our national life has brought, however,
from time to time, certain moments when there
has emanated from the people a voice more distinctly
local in its suggestions, not entirely lacking the influence
of a borrowed expression, but blending with it a
certain flavor of its own and thereby creating a sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
of music in the folk-manner. Such were the songs of
Stephen Foster, and such were the patriotic songs of
the Civil War times, and in these two contributions
to our native music we have the most genuinely and
deeply emotional expressions that have yet sprung
from Americans of European origin. Previous to the
appearance of these, the complexion of our music had
been almost entirely English, consisting as it did of
patriotic or sentimental songs either actually imported
from England or locally written songs which copied
the English models so slavishly as to lose all distinction.</p>

<p>The negro element began at an early epoch to bear
an influence on our expressions. As the one keenly
suffering people in our midst, leading a life of elemental
toil and possessing richly endowed musical natures,
the negro, with his intensely emotional expression,
was bound to make himself heard and felt
throughout the land, and his songs entered largely into
the fibre of our own expression. But even the most
ardent supporter of the practice of employing the negro
element as a basis for American music must admit that
there is much of the exotic about it, and that by
its employment alone our native art will never attain
to that desideratum of the American composer, a nationalistic
feeling.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked in commenting on this
subject how Dvořák in handling this negro element
remained unequivocally Slavic in idiom, and it has
been noted, also, with what scant success our own composers
have pursued the same efforts toward concocting
what would seem an indigenous art. That such a
nationalistic art, when it does finally evolve, will contain
a strong strain of these various influences is undoubtedly
the case, but the tinge of real local atmosphere
which will constitute its nationalism will be an
intangible quality not existing in any defined formula.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
It will not possess salient external features which our
own composers may seize upon, but it will be charged
with a consciousness that shall be inherent in the composers
themselves and shall find unconscious voicing in
their melodies. It is not unreasonable to suppose that
it is from what we generally designate as our 'popular
music' that such an art will emanate; from the street,
the theatre, the dance hall, and more particularly
from the sentimentalities of the popular songs which
periodically hold the affections of such a vast public.
Ephemeral as is the mass of this music that annually
sweeps over our country, each phase of it leaves its
mark, some deeper than others, but all contributing to
the upbuilding of the national character of our music.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Let us turn our attention to a brief survey of some
of these phases of the popular music, both past and
present.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the bulk of this music may be
classified into the two form-divisions which distinguish
the main orders of all musical art—the dance and the
song form, the rhythmic and the lyric. While the latter
predominated in the popular music of past decades,
the present-day tendencies give greater importance to
the dance and even the larger part of our popular
songs are set to the more enlivening rhythms of the
prevailing dance measures. We have seen that the
'minstrel show' provided the medium whereby the first
purveyors of popular music reached the public. It
was through the means of this popular entertainment
that many of the early favorites reached fame. With
the rise of the vaudeville or 'variety show' the character
of popular music underwent a considerable change.
The introduction of the comic song brought a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span>
element into its nature and then came that slough
of sentimentalism which was to remove from our popular
music the naïve but sincere appeal of the old ballads
and replace them with the more sophisticated but
vulgar frivolities.</p>

<p>The sentimental song has, however, never entirely
disappeared from the popular répertoire; it has, indeed,
persistently maintained a considerable place in
the affections of every period. Even the younger of
our own generation can recall the phase of popular
taste that existed just before the inauguration of a new
order in the appearance of 'ragtime.' Almost all of
the then popular melodies consisted of songs replete
with the so-called 'heart quality.' The mild eroticism
of 'Sweet Marie' and 'The Sweetest Story ever Told'
shared the popular favor with the patriotically sentimental
'Comrades' and 'Just Break the News to
Mother,' songs in which the memory of the war lingered
and which were prompted by the success of the
military drama. While the popularity of these songs
has been great, the public has been indifferent to the
composers, and they have had to be content with an
almost anonymous fame. Some of the men who represent
this past decade of the sentimental song are:
Charles K. Harris, whose greatest success was 'After
the Ball'; Charles Graham, Felix McGlennon, H. W.
Petrie, and Paul Dresser.</p>

<p>The reappearance of the negro-element in the form
of the 'coon song' marks an important epoch in the
evolution of our popular music. The 'coon song' presents
to us the light-hearted side of the negro; the
pathos of the slave is never presented in these later
negro songs—only the 'darky's' picturesqueness, his
quasi-humorous vagabondage, and, in the more vulgarized
types, his frenzied ribaldry.</p>

<p>The coon song has passed through a number of development
stages. The first examples, such as 'Kentucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
Babe' and 'Little Alabama Coon,' were of a naïve
variety which contained but the merest suggestion of
the real negro element. There has been a subsequently
wider utilization of the syncopated rhythms which constitute
the popularities of 'ragtime' and present-day
examples, such as 'Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee,' represent
a rather complicated and decidedly more characteristic
type than do the coon songs of preceding seasons.</p>

<p>Following the success of the coon song there was
an exploitation of the 'Indian' song. These songs were
even less genuine in origin than their antecedents. The
Indian element was often obtained by the employment
of a sort of garbled Oriental ragtime or of a disguised
Celtic idiom, and only the titles revealed these compositions
as Indian. 'Hiawatha' and 'Tammany' were
among the first of these songs, and they were followed
by a large number of imitations.</p>

<p>Besides these two principal classes of popular music
employing a local color in its idiom, countless experiments
have been made with other varieties. The
Oriental has been much used and the refrain of the
once popular 'Streets of Cairo' has served as the 'leitmotif'
of a thousand and one pieces partaking of a
pseudo-Orientalism. The Irish song has had a persistent
vogue; it has several representative types; the
sentimental 'Annie Rooney' and 'Maggie Murphy' of
earlier days have been succeeded by the more boisterous
'Bedelia' and the perennial 'Mr. Dooley.' There
is usually a saving grace of humor in these Hibernian
offerings which palliates even their most patent vulgarity.</p>

<p>The vogue of the more recent popular music has
been dictated by the various dance fads which have
lately seized the public fancy. First the 'turkey trot'
and 'barn dance' brought forth such originalities as
'Alexander's Rag Time Band' and 'Everybody's Doin'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
It,' these to be followed by an avalanche of various
'glides' and 'rags.' The music of the dances and dance
songs is unique in its blending of certain negro qualities
of rhythm and melody with a strange indeterminate
sense of something Slavic or Oriental in their
abandon. The last aspect of popular dance music is
that furnished by the importation of the 'tango,' maxixe
and other Latin American dances. Most of the more
popular tunes to which these steps are danced are pronouncedly
Spanish and have in most cases been imported
with the dances themselves.</p>

<p>An ingenious procedure on the part of the popular
composer has been to weave into the verse or refrain of
a song a few measures of some well-known popular
classic. One of the first and perhaps the best known
example is the use of Mendelssohn's 'Spring Song' in
the refrain of the song so disrespectfully called 'That
Mendelssohn Rag.' Following this there have appeared
many such appropriations and nearly the entire list
of the popular melodies of the standard classics has
been thus utilized.</p>

<p>Viewed as a whole, the popular music of to-day presents
an expression far in advance of that of even a
few years ago. Some of it contains subtleties of harmonic
and rhythmic design that would have been caviar
to the public of yesterday. It is to be regretted that
this advance in form has been made at the sacrifice
of the more ingenious spirit of the early popular music,
and that the tone of most of our popular music
to-day is so uniformly vulgar.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>There is a middle world of music that touches, on
its one side, the more elevated regions of art, while,
on the other, it does not lose its hold on the larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
world of popular taste. This is the world of comic
opera—using the term in its general sense of a stage
piece with music of a lighter variety.</p>

<p>The American public was early taught to appreciate
this form of artistic amusement; the history of opera
in this country shows a continuous record of the
production of such works in all the larger cities.
Important agencies in the popularizing of comic
opera were the early performances of the Gilbert
and Sullivan operettas, the brilliant seasons of French
and Viennese opera at the Casino Theatre in New
York, and the excellent services of the Bostonians
in presenting ideally some of the most charming of the
standard répertoire, besides revealing the merit of our
native composers, in giving with success some of the
first American comic operas to reach public hearing.</p>

<p>Up to the time of the Bostonians' championship of
the American light opera composer there has been but
an occasional performance of some work of local interest.
Julius Eichberg is generally accredited with
being America's first comic opera composer, his fame
resting largely on a popular work entitled 'The Doctor
of Alcantara' that was produced in Boston in 1862.
Eichberg could be called an American composer only
in that an American city happened to be the scene of
his activities. There is nothing about his work to give
it any special significance as American.</p>

<p>In fact, as we look over the entire product of our
light opera composers, we are forced again to deplore
the lack of a distinctive vein or local sense that would
put the national seal on America's many and notable
achievements in this field. Even England, whose cultivated
art is almost as devoid of a national feeling as
is America's, has, in the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas,
works of a truly national significance. Mr. Krehbiel
has observed that George Ade has the requisite equipment
of an American Gilbert, but that as yet there has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
not been found the composer who could be his Sullivan.</p>

<p>To assert convincingly America's claims to having
contributed largely and valuably to the world's comic
operas we have only to put forward these names:
Reginald de Koven, Victor Herbert, and John Philip
Sousa. The first name in this group is of one who is
perhaps more closely identified with the comic opera
stage than any other living composer. Reginald de
Koven was born in 1861 at Middletown, Conn. After
graduating at Oxford University in 1880 he began his
career as a musician by studying in several European
cities. The studies which were to bear the greatest
fruit were those pursued under that master of comic
opera, Suppé. On returning to America Mr. de Koven
resided for some years in Chicago, where he did musical
journalism and wrote the experimental scores that
preceded his first and greatest success, 'Robin Hood.'
Mr. de Koven's career since coming into the fame to
which this work has brought him has been too familiar
to need recounting. He is as well known for his
songs as for his operas and his place in the lists of
American lyricists is noted in Chapter XII.</p>

<p>If any of our younger composers of comic opera are
possessed of an artistic ideal, doubtless in nine out of
ten cases it is to write an opera that shall combine the
sterling worth of good music with telling popular qualities
in the measure that 'Robin Hood' does it. It is
too late a day to write either a description or analysis
of a work every page of which is familiar to the great
majority of our music-loving public. It alone, of all
the successes of past years, survives in the popular affection;
and it is reassuring to those who fear an ultimate
total depravity of taste that his work of charming
grace and color can still hold the boards. 'Robin
Hood' was the third opera which de Koven wrote. It
was produced in 1890 by the Bostonians. Its success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
was not at first marked, but it did not take long for it
to find its place, and it is estimated that the work now
has over three thousand performances to its credit.</p>

<p>De Koven in this appealing work has successfully
simulated the hale and hearty style of the English ballad
and the idyllic simplicity of the country dance and
pastoral scene. With these qualities he has combined
the richer warmth of a glowing romantic melodiousness
and a graceful and lilting gaiety after methods of
the Viennese and French schools. Vocally stirring and
effective in both its solo parts and ensembles, colorful
if not brilliant in its orchestration, 'Robin Hood' is
a masterpiece of its <em>genre</em>. Withal de Koven is always
natural and spontaneously straightforward—traits that
have laid him open to the accusation of persistent plagiarism.
Mr. de Koven does at times employ themes
that suggest other works, but this is true of many another
composer whose integrity is unquestioned, and
there is much truth in Mr. Hughes' designation of de
Koven as 'the best abused composer in America.'</p>

<p>Since the success of 'Robin Hood' Mr. de Koven has
been in the unfortunate position of a man attempting
to repeat a success along similar lines. Once only has
he made any near approach to it and that in his seventh
opera, 'Rob Roy' (produced in 1894). There is
in this score much of the same freshness that characterizes
'Robin Hood,' and its melodies are not too reminiscent
of the earlier works. The same cannot be said
of many of de Koven's other operas, for in his less inspired
moments the composer's heartiness becomes a
rather too square pomposity and his lighter moments
often descend to a banality unworthy of his best style.
The following are among the other operas of de Koven,
with the dates of their productions: 'The Begum'
(1887), 'Don Quixote' (1889), 'The Fencing Master'
(1892), 'The Knickerbockers' (1893), 'The Algerian'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
(1893), 'The Tsigane' (1895), 'The Mandarin' (1896),
'The Paris Doll' (1897), 'The Highwayman' (1897).</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Victor Herbert in his comic operas has contrived to
write in a vein somewhat more varied than de Koven.
While he has never achieved a success to equal that of
'Robin Hood,' his operas taken as a whole exhibit a
more sustained power of invention and inspiration than
those of de Koven. Herbert's style is more marked by
piquancy and lightness, but he is not lacking in a melodic
sense both charming and natural.</p>

<p>Herbert's style has undergone an evolution since his
entrance into the comic opera field. His earlier works,
such as 'The Wizard of the Nile,' 'The Serenade,' and
'The Idol's Eye,' are very simple in structure, while in
some of his later works he employs an ambitious
scheme that the laity are wont to identify with 'grand'
opera. Some of Herbert's later scores are: 'The Red
Mill,' 'Mlle. Modiste,' 'Algeria,' and 'Sweethearts.' Mr.
Herbert was born in Ireland in 1859, was musically
educated in Germany, and came to America at about
the age of twenty-seven as solo 'cellist to the Metropolitan
Opera House. His 'Americanism' is, therefore, acquired.</p>

<p>John Philip Sousa's fame, as is well known, is not
primarily that of an opera composer. As the 'march
king' Mr. Sousa's fame is as unique as it is deserved.
Sousa is of German-Spanish descent. He was born in
Washington in 1859. His career has been one of rich
practical experience and opportunity, leading to an engagement
as the leader of the United States Marine
Band. In 1892 he organized the band which bears his
own name and that organization has, perhaps, a more
world-wide fame than any other feature of our musical
life.</p>

<p>Mr. Sousa has been often held up as the most representative
of American composers, an estimate that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
not without considerable truth. An analogy has been
made between the Strauss waltzes and the Sousa
marches: the latter have not perhaps so much art as
the former, but they are all admirable pieces of composition,
solid in harmonic structure, and stirring in
their melodic directness. 'The Washington Post,' 'The
Liberty Bell,' 'The High School Cadets,' and 'King Cotton'
have each, in turn, inspired the land with their
martial vigor, while 'The Stars and Stripes Forever'
has become permanent in the people's affections, being,
indeed, a national anthem more eloquent in Americanism
than many of the tunes that bear the official seal
as such.</p>

<p>Sousa has written several comic operas. One only
of these, 'El Capitan,' has met with success. It contains
much music of an agreeable brilliancy and gracefulness,
notably one of the best examples of the composer's
marches. There is lacking, however, in Sousa's
music a quality very essential to the rounding out of
a successful opera score. We refer to the more sensuous
melodic line which lends color to the sustained
portions of a work. Later operas of Sousa include:
'The Bride Elect,' 'The Charlatan,' 'Chris and the Wonderful
Lamp,' and 'The Glass Blowers,' and it may be
added that Mr. Sousa has made several incursions into
the field of more serious music, having written a symphonic
poem and several other works for orchestra.</p>

<p>One of the most prolific composers of American light
opera was Julian Edwards (1855-1910). Mr. Edwards'
list of about twenty operas includes the names of several
that have had remarkable success. 'Brian Boru'
and 'Dolly Varden' are more than names to many. In
1904 Mr. Edwards wrote the opera 'Love's Lottery,'
which served as the vehicle whereby Mme. Schumann-Heink
entered the comic opera field.</p>

<p>Ludwig Englander and Gustav Luders are other
names endeared to American comic opera lovers. Both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
are of foreign birth, however. The operas of the
latter include 'King Dodo,' 'Grand Mogul,' and 'The
Prince of Pilsen,' all works which, though neither
marked by originality nor over-refined, contained
enough of musical vitality to have won a place in the
public esteem.</p>

<p>Less known writers who have from time to time
added their quota to the country's enlivening and tuneful
music include: G. Thorne, whose opera, 'A Maid of
Plymouth,' was one of the first in the répertoire of
the Bostonians; Henry Waller, the composer of 'Olgallalas,'
which was also produced by the Bostonians;
Carl Pflueger, who wrote '1492,' given by the Boston
Cadets, an amateur organization, in one of their excellent
productions; and Barnet, whose 'Jack and the
Beanstalk' was also sung at one of the Cadets' 'shows.'</p>

<p>Several of the more serious composers have essayed
the comic opera, not always successfully. George W.
Chadwick's 'Tabasco,' first produced by the Boston
Cadets, had a fair success when subsequently given
professionally, but Edgar Stillman-Kelley's 'Puritania'
and Henry Hadley's 'Nancy Brown' were decided failures.
One of the recent successes was Deems Taylor's
'The Echo,' originally written as a college 'show' but
achieving a long run on New York's Broadway.</p>

<p>Viewed in the light of present-day conditions and
compared with the class of works that constitute the
large part of modern musical stage-works, most of the
foregoing operas may be classed as hopelessly old-fashioned
and <em>passé</em>. The decline of comic opera commenced
with the ascendency of the English 'musical
comedy.' There are, it is true, many works of the
latter order that contain pages of music far better than
what is to be found in many of the more strictly
operatic works. Such works as 'Florodora' and 'The
Geisha,' as well as many later ones, have had much
charm and refinement. It is the tendency of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
works to abolish the romantic strain of the old-fashioned
opera that constitutes its baneful influence. The
play and the music have become gradually more and
more divorced and to-day the musical portions of such
a work have little or no bearing on the action or the
scene, but consist almost entirely of topical songs introduced
in much the same irrelevant manner in which
they are so ingeniously brought into a vaudeville 'act.'
Paraphrasing Voltaire, the majority of this degenerate
class is neither musical nor comic.</p>

<p>This is the direction followed by our lighter musical
plays of most recent times. It is to be regretted that
the grace and refinement that marks many of the English
musical comedies is so entirely lacking in the American
imitations of the same class. A note of vulgarity
insinuates itself unfailingly into the bulk of our contemporaneous
popular music. Flagrant examples of
the ultimate type of musical play above described are
those of George M. Cohan, in whose inspiration some
have seen the first manifestation of the American
'genius.' The titles of some of Mr. Cohan's plays, such
as 'Yankee Doodle Boy,' 'Little Johnny Jones,' and
'George Washington, Jr.,' reveal the jingoistic qualities
of his inspirations. The musical numbers of these
works are expressed in terms more or less Mr. Cohan's
own. He has utilized 'ragtime' largely and in the rhythmical
excitement of his songs lies their strongest appeal.
Other authors whose works follow generally
either the Americanized form of the English musical
comedy or the more distinctly native form of Mr. Cohan's
'musical shows' are: Jean Schwartz, Silvio Hein,
Gus Edwards, Manuel Klein, Raymond Hubbel, and
Robert H. Bowers.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that there will be a return to the
more legitimate forms of lighter operas and that a
revival of taste for the more refined forms of stage
work may soon offer again to the American composer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
opportunities to demonstrate the very suitable field
which this branch of the art offers to his talent. An
optimistic observer of present conditions may see in
the unqualified vulgarity of our popular music to-day
only the token of a vitality which, when softened by
the refining touch of the next decade, shall result in
an expression of individual charm.</p>
